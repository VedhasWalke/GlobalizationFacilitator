Every time I visit Princeton, my time there will almost always begin or end with some delicious ice cream from The Bent Spoon.

A real gem

 It's an "addiction" I can still relate to.

Have been coming here for the past 4 years

Those businesses do not deserve our support or a second chance.

I am saddened the chefs aren’t what they used to be

I wish they would tear the place down after 15 years

///

I used to come here everyday since i was a kid, i have not gone one month without it

///

My children go to it everyday

///

For the past two years, the Bent Spoon has field my ice-cream addiction

///

This was always my go-to spot for ice cream

///

I’ve been coming here for the past 17 months

///
The past 2 weeks, i have never had any issue

///

To experience the true feeling of this place, you need to come here for a while, like me

I always find myself coming here most of the time

The food is consistently delicious,

This place is always good vibes & a cozy ambiencez.

we love coming back here

So far, I have dined twice with the outdoor seating setup of the restaurant

never failed to deliver a pleasant dining experience.

It is incredibly rare that I stumble across a restaurant that makes me excited to return. Agricola is one of them.

I have been there for brunches, dinner and casual bar evenings and they have all been great.

Highly recommended if in the Princeton area!

Have been coming for a long time

Love going here

Every time I visit Princeton, my time there will almost always begin or end with some delicious ice cream from The Bent Spoon.

A real gem

 It's an "addiction" I can still relate to.

Bent Spoon is a Princeton classic.

This place is clearly well known.

This is a highlight of my trip every time I go to Princeton.

I usually always go off times and off season since the lines for this place can get seriously long.

 I had been coming here for years

So I am a regular customer for a few years

Those businesses do not deserve our support or a second chance.

I’ve been going here for almost 4 years!!

The quality has degraded the past few years

I am saddened the chefs aren’t what they used to be

I wish they would tear the place down after 15 years

I used to come here everyday since i was a kid, i have not gone one month without it

My children go to it everyday

For the past two years, the Bent Spoon has field my ice-cream addiction

This was always my go-to spot for ice cream

I’ve been coming here for the past 17 months

The past 2 weeks, i have never had any issue

It is incredibly rare that I stumble across a restaurant that makes me excited to return. Agricola is one of them.

 I always get 

///

Value is degrading

///

Love going here

///

Every time I visit Princeton, my time there will almost always begin or end with some delicious ice cream from The Bent Spoon.

///

A real gem

///

 It's an "addiction" I can still relate to.

///

Bent Spoon is a Princeton classic.

///

This place is clearly well known.

///

I usually always go off times and off season since the lines for this place can get seriously long.

///

Absolute favorite ice cream shop!

///

Have been coming here for the past 4 years

///

I feel like this review might be (approximately) 11 years overdue...

///

 I had been coming here for years

///

 having tried tons of their flavors over the years, they never disappoint. 

///

So I am a regular customer for a few years

///


Those businesses do not deserve our support or a second chance.

///

I’ve been going here for almost 4 years!!

///

The quality has degraded the past few years

///

I am saddened the chefs aren’t what they used to be

///

I wish they would tear the place down after 15 years

///

I used to come here everyday since i was a kid, i have not gone one month without it

///

My children go to it everyday

///

For the past two years, the Bent Spoon has field my ice-cream addiction

///

This was always my go-to spot for ice cream

///

I’ve been coming here for the past 17 months

///
The past 2 weeks, i have never had any issue

///

To experience the true feeling of this place, you need to come here for a while, like me

///

I have a membership card, since i come here so often!


///

I love this place for quite some time!
