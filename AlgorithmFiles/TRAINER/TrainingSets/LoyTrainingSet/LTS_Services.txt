Could never be happier with another company

Has been on my list of professionals for years now

He is actually the only repair/service person I allow in my home when I'm not there.

///

We have been in touch for a year now

He always makes sure to clean up after he leaves too.

///

 if you have a plumbing problem stop scrolling, give them a call, always amazing

///

Always happy to work with him

///

I have to say for years I always used

///

We've used Dov for a couple of problems so far

///

 He has been my go-to plumber for years,

///

He's consistently professional and trustworthy, always quick to respond, show up, and complete the project in a timely manner.

///

Great company. They show up fast and get the job done each time.

///

Best person in this line of work.

///

Always reliable, reasonable and gets the jobs done.

///

I only call him when I need service.

///

Dov is awesome! He's consistently on time, responsive to my inquiries and does great work. 

///

I never call anyone else!

///

Great service again and he is an honest guy.

///

He has been punctual, fast, professional, pleasant, and thorough.

///

I  don't believe you could find a better plumber anywhere.

///

Fast and reliable. No surprise charges or pricing. Never.

///

If your drain is clogged, call this guy!! 

///

Dov is really great and I recommend him on his promptness and care certainly prior to actually meeting his client and making the repairs.

///

Been on speed dial ever since

///

Dov has come by our apartment several times

///

 Easily the best plumber and home service man I've ever had the pleasure of working with.

///

If I ever need a plumber for anything, I call him.

///

My point is Dov is smart and knows what he's doing.

///

And he won't try to overcharge you by recommending something you don't need. 

///

But Dov is excellent at what he does. 

///

He's capable, competent, smart, honest, straight-forward and hard working.

///

I respect him highly and would say he's the person you should call for your plumbing issue.

///

He is a true professional and a very nice person. He has my highest recommendation.

///

Dov is always quick to respond, clear on price, and efficient in his execution of all plumbing related tasks. I highly recommended Dov Sewer and Drain.

///

 Definitely, this guy's the one you should call. Always. 

///

Call Dov to get it fixed, I'm sure you'll stay happy like me

///

Can't recommend enough. He's good at what he does.

///

I have his number on my fridge.

///

Worth every penny, as always

///

Very responsive and reliable. 

///

Dov and Jacob show up when they say they will, and get the job done.

///

it's really a blessing to have plumbing pros I can rely on.

///

Working with Dov is a pleasure.

///

Can't recommend them enough.

///

The only plumber i will ever call!

///

 Can't say enough about his professionalism and I would recommend this guy any day!

///

Great, professional, and quick service. I could not recommend more.

///

We've used him in the past and plan to call him again for any future plumbing needs.

///

Dov does great work. Hire him whenever you need a plumbing job WELL DONE. 

///

Dov clearly knows what he is doing, and he does great work in a way that is affordable, fast, and a great learning experience.

///

He's pretty much a genius. 

///

 I have had Dov repair everything from plumbing to air vents and appliances. 

///

He's incredibly personable, takes the job really really seriously and is absolutely incredibly reliable. 

///

He is my go to guy and hope that'll be the case for many years.

I'd always recommend them if you're looking for a worry-free cleaning experience!
