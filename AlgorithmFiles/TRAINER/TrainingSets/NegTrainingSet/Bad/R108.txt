Stopped in to pick up their version of Chana.    I feel like I had last been inside over 5 years ago.  For some reason had never gone back.   Decor looked better than I had remembered.   The food was disappointing.   I requested my dish At a medium spice level.   They prepared it with just spice and no flavor.   Reminded me of the overrated food at mehek (haven't been there in a few years either so perhaps that is better now?).  I might give this place one more try because it's local and it's possible that I didn't order their best dish, but so far not a fan
