Tonight we ordered from Crown of India, when Ganges was not answering their phone.  I think I can sum it up by saying it was the first time in 20 years of eating indian food that we threw away the leftovers.  The food was extremely greasy and everything was overloaded with onions.  I like onions, but we had Chicken Tikka Masala that contained more onions in the sauce than chicken.  The samosas were sitting in a pool of oil, as were the papadum.  It was a bummer, because they gave plenty of rice, threw in a little container of watery dal, so upon opening the bag, the prospects were looking good.  In any case, I would have given three stars for flavor, one star due to grease, so we settled on two . . .
