We had catered food from this place for a graduation ceremony. Quite possibly the WORST catered food in my memory. For appetizers there were gobi and aloo pakoras which were 95% batter and absolutely tasteless, soggy, and greasy. There were also spinach and cheese pockets ( it was hard to tell what everything was except for the batter). My stomach was churning even as I ate the food, and later I went and scoped out the restrooms in the building just to make sure. And then there was dinner! Clumpy jeera rice, bland and creamy paneer makhani, mushy naan,  some weird spinach dish (incidentally the first time i saw chickpeas and aloo cooked in saag). There was ANOTHER channa dish floating in a pool of oil and overly spiced curry which was still tasteless. Then we had to endure dessert, which was little bits of sugary kulfi which made the kids run around wildly. All the food, as expected, made the entire family sick for the next few days.
