had dinner at crowne of india tonight with another couple. terrible experience, they put dinner plate on top of silverware we had to open the wine ourselves  we ordered the chicken saag with white meat chicken breast one dish mild the other medium they were both dark meat and mild sauce and the dish was not even warm the sauce the runny and tasteless, i asked to have it changed to what we had ordered they said oh we can only do that if u wait at least 20 minutes the other people had their dinner and i did not want them to wait so I never had dinner i just sent it back we ordered rarita and asked for it twice they never brought it the waiter didn't seem to care there were only a few other tables and plenty of waiters there. i just came home and made myself dinner, we will never ever go there again or recommend it.they said we didn't charge u for the rarita or the chicken dish they took back oh how nice of them !!!
