This was unfortunately the worst Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at, which is sad considering the majority of the reviews have been favorable. I went here for dinner, which might explain the discrepancy in the good lunch buffet menu. First of all, the food, with the exception of the naan, did not arrive hot, only warm. Overall, the food was not seasoned well; none of the food boasted curry flavor or other traditional Indian spices. Usually, when I walk into an Indian restaurant, my nose is treated to a beautiful warm bouquet of curry, anise, cinnamon, and cardamom. Not here! The coconut soup was bland, seasoned with nothing more than sliced almonds. Completely untraditional (usually pistachios are present) and completely useless in this soup as they did not add any depth at all. The chicken in my tiki masala was tough and chewy, the sauce was not delicately creamy, spicy, or even flavorful. The rice was so greasy it coated the spoon and dish it was served on. Like everything else, it had no Indian seasoning. The lassis and the naan was the only redeeming factors to the meal, but not spectacular enough to warrant returning. I felt like someone who was not Indian was cooking in the kitchen that day.  Do not go here if you have had spectacular Indian food in the past. This restaurant does not represent true quality Indian cooking. After reading the other reviews, I wonder if we were served leftovers from the buffet because our food came out so tough and barely heated through.
