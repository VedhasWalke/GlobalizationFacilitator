Ordered the chicken tika. It was ok. It came with a tiny side of rice and about 6 pieces of chicken for about 20 bucks. I more than likely will not be returning. Also the cook that works there is the not the friendliest person. You'd think that with all these businesses around they'd be a little nicer.
