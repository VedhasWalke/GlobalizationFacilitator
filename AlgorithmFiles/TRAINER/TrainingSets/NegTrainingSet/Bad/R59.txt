The food and service have always been genuinely bland. Didn't care enough to leave a review before but wife got a veggie biryani the other day and the only two vegetables in it were carrots and lima beans! They seem to have added red chilli powder on top to make it spicy. Not going here again anytime soon, especially with all the newer Indian restaurants in Plainsboro.
