Got chicken biryani delivered from here.  It was simply not very good - there are many competing Indian restaurants in the area that do a better job for the same price. The rice was kind of bland and didn't have the depth of spices that make a biryani really delicious, and the chicken was unremarkable. I can't imagine I'll be getting food from here again, but if I do, I'll definitely order something else.
