Food and Service are average, the one thing that an Indian guy wants in an Indian restaurant is GOOD tasting food, but this place falls short. I tried chicken and was cooked well but unhealthy as the chicken seemed to be fried and then added to the gravy.. We went there on a weekend and the place was deserted. This is not a good first impression and instantly makes me feel like the food might not be freshly made. About ambience, looks classy but a closer look reveals the dusty looking curtains and seats. Seating is awkward and this may be a personal preference for not favoring immovable sofa seats that are at arm`s length from the dinner table. I feel like my food is travelling a lot before it reached by mouth from the plates. The green chutney they serve as a compliment with the papad looked and tasted like chutney-water rather than thick saucy chutney. Server seemed to be clueless about the ingredients in some of the dishes. If anyone from management is reading, please take a note that your servers "must" know what kind of food is being served and what ingredients go in which preparation. Also, stop staring at guest guys. Leave them alone. I liked the fact that the chef brought our food to the table. The place does not serve liquor but has BYOB and the liquor store is right next to the restaurant.
