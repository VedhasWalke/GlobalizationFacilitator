The food here is tasty no doubt, but the indifferent service kills the joy of eating.
It takes forever for someone to take our orders and another eternity to be served.  This is on an off day when there are just 2-3 tables to be served. The waiter's attitude is appalling, though the owner is pretty nice. Next time, I will just take out and eat at home.
BYOB!
