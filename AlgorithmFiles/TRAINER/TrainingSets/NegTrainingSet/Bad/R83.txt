The recent largely positive reviews for this place gave me false hope. Watch out if multiple tables are seated because the wait staff simply can't multitask. You are approached once for placing your order and once at the end of the meal, and even then, you will have to hunt down somebody to get your check.  I decided I wanted to drink a lassi a minute after placing my order, but the lady who took the order disappeared, so then decided against it. Some other person delivered food to the table and then nobody bothered to ask how the food was. We ordered one paneer dish and one chicken dish of medium spiciness and the food which came out was extremely spicy. I had to flag down a guy who stared at the dish and said it was way too red/spicy...well duh! I asked for one of them to be remade, which unnecessarily prolonged what was supposed to be a quick meal. The chicken in the chicken makhani was of extremely poor quality compared to other places in the area. You'd think a place that has been around so many years would invest in some quality ingredients, especially with so many decent competitors in the area. After my meal, I went up to the podium to pay since I expected nobody to show up to the table based on how the service went. I had a certificate & the whole process of having the certificate verified/getting rung up took almost 7-10 minutes, which only added to the frustration. The food here was well below average, and the service was so poor, I don't find myself ever coming back here. I hear they opened up a new location in West Windsor, but won't be giving that new place a shot because I can only expect the same poor quality ingredients are being ordered by ownership for the other location.
