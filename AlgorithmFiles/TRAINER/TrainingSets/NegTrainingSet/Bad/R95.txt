I was very excited about visiting Crown of India after reading the reviews, but sadly, I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.  Not only was the food only moderately warm - none of it came out in any reasonable amount of time.  I appreciate that the staff wanted to serve our table all at the same time, but when appetizers are soup and samosas, the samosas shouldn't come out in 3 minutes and the soup in 15.  The food aside (nothing exciting in the food means there is not much to write about) - when we got there, the place was EMPTY.  We were the only ones there.  Shortly after being seated a group of 12 women came in together and they sat them practically on top of us.  The place is huge, give us a little breathing room.  
As others have said - if you have had GOOD Indian in the past, skip this place
