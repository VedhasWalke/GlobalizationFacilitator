couple months  tried  today   think  actually sounds  bit worse let  make  simple;   October Rust  perfect  enjoy  entire cd every single song world Coming   great  thought  70%    excellent  Life  Killing  came    thought   rather disappointing   care   direction   going    still enjoyed  30%  it  new cd sounds like  worst parts  Life  Killing  stretched    entire cd  guess   liked  last cd  thought songs like Electrocute Nettie   Dream  Dead  lame maybe  like this like  demo cd  local bar band handed  found  album quite boring  Type O Negative   lacked  dark humor  heavymetal musicality    albums have  Sorry Type O Negative   buy  album  couldn't even listen   whole thing once  Spend  money   fav October Rust type O   \give      ten listens  understand   discover  depths\  pure
