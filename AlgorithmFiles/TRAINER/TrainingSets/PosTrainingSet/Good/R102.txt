By far my favorite Indian restaurant. Every thing I have tried here has been great. The only complaints I have is that the buffet is a little on the pricey side for a lunch buffet and some of the buffet items taste better when ordered a la cart. I have tried many other Indian restaurants and none of them compare to Crown.
