Agreeing with the previous reviewer. I lived in Plainsboro twice, totalling about 6 years, and this was an often visited restaurant. The mixed platter was a favorite, although we'd usually take the meat that was only OK and add it to the sauce of the fantastic chicken makhni. Samosas are really good, and always finish with their gulab jamun.

Staff is really nice, decor is fine, and the buffet - although I haven't been in years - was always pretty busy during the week. Considering the ethnic makeup of Plainsboro, this is a great Indian restaurant to have locally, but people may not think of going to it because of it's strip-mall location. I definitely say give it a try if you're in the area!
