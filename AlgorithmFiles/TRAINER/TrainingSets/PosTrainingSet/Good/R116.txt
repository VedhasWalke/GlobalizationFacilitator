We hosted my sister's wedding reception at the Crown of India this past month, and it was a huge success!!  Mr. Suggy, Brian, and the staff accommodated all of our requests (color scheme, theme, last minute center piece set up) and ensured that everything was ready by the time we got there.  The guests loved the food and were very impressed with the space, décor, and how well organized they were overall!  The service is very friendly and professional and everyone went to great lengths to ensure the party was enjoyable by all.  We definitely recommend this place for any party!!
