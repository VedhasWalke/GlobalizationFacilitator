Five stars for the dinner option, four stars for the lunch buffet. A lunch buffet is NEVER going to be as good as a personal meal, because 1) it's sitting out for an extended period of time, and 2) it's made to be as inoffensive (not-spicy) as possible so as to appeal to as many people as possible. The tika masala and saag paneer here are heavenly. I moved away and whenever I return to visit old friends I make it a point to eat here.
