Went there on a date and Indian was exactly what we were craving on a brisk, autumn night.  She had the chicken makhani and I had the lamb rogan josh and the dishes were great: the meat was tender and the curries they were prepared in were so deep and rich in flavor.  The servers were so nice to us and were very attentive.  I've also been there during the week for business lunch and their buffet is fantastic.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the the Mercer County area looking for authentic Indian cuisine.
