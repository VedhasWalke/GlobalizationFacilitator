I took my mother here for Mother's Day and we had an absolutely lovely time! The special lunch buffet they had was so delicious! So many options and just honestly good food. They had music playing which was nice and who I think was the owner kept coming to check on us which was so nice! He suggested we try the ice cream that is homemade at their other location and OMG IT WAS THE BEST. From that moment on for the rest of the day we literately couldn't stop talking about how amazing the mango and coconut ice cream was. And at the end the price was extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of food and attention that we had received. 10/10 would recommend.
