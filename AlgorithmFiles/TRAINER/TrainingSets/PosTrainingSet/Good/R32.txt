This was my first time at the restaurant. Amazing food! Such great flavor. And, the service was very friendly. The waitresses and owner kept us comfortable, happy and well fed. We ordered the non-vegetable platter for an appetizer; and, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, chicken korma and tandoori chicken for a meal. It fed the four of us very well and again was delicious. BYOB was an added bonus! We will definitely come back often! The buffet set up for lunch looks incredible... :)
