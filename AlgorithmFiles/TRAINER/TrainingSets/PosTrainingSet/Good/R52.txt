Crown of India is one of the best Indian restaurant in NJ/NY/Philly. Been to a lot of Indian places and their food is very authentic and the service is amazing. The owner Mr. Suggy is the best and he takes care of everyone. Their New Year's party was simply outstanding. very well organized and food was yummy
