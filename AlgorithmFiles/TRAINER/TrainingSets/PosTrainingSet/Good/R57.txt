I've eaten at this restaurant more times than I can count and I'm never disappointed! My family and I go there for dinner and get take out fairly regularly. The malai kofta and paneer mumtaz are particularly loved and their hulwa is delicious. Although it's predominantly north Indian curries, they added a south Indian menu a few years ago so you can order dosa, uttupam, and a few other dishes. Always a delicious choice of restaurant!
