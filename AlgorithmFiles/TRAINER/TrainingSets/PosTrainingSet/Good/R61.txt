My wife and I really like Indian food and are always on the look out for a restaurant in our area that we would like we'll enough to patronize on  a repeat basis.

We stumbled upon *The Crown of India* last night while shopping, decided to try it and were delighted.

We especially enjoyed the Baingan Bharta (eggplant), chicken  Tikka Marsalis and vegetable Biriyani.

Service was excellent and the proprietor very friendly.
