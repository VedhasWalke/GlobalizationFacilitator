We went to this shopping center for Malaysia food, but too many people there, so we changed to Crown of India in the same shopping center. It was far better than we expected. Buffet food was very tasty, naan bread was soft. The restaurant is neat and the deco is very nice. We had very good experience, no complaint at all. Definitely we will go back there.
