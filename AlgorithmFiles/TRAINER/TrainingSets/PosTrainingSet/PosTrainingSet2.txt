 As another customer mentioned, Crown of India, stayed open longer past closing time because I was running late; it was the middle of June of 2020 and I was visiting my mother outside of a rehabilitation center and just felt terrible leaving her. I called to notify crown of India and they told me not to worry they will be here when I get there. I thought that was very thoughtful of them. As for the food, it's amazing and it is my go-to whenever I would like Indian food. I am currently living in East Windsor, and have plenty, once again, plenty of choices however, they don't do some of the special things that I request from Crown of India and this is what makes Crown of India my go-to Indian restaurant despite the long drive, in my opinion, since there are plenty of Indian restaurants that I could order from and take out. Portions are plenty, the sauces are incredible, the roti is perfect as are the staff that works there! as many times as I've been there I'm disappointed,though, to find out that for every $50 that you spend you receive $10 in Crown of India cash to spend at the restaurant...

 I am a regular here, and I always enjoy my experience. Over living in Plainsboro for several years, I have enjoyed Crown of India through sit-in dining, the lunch buffet, and take out. All have been excellent experiences. Some other reviewers seem very knowlegeable about Indian food. I do not have as much experience with Indian, so my tastes may not be so discerning. But I have eaten at many other places and very much preferred the food at Crown of India. 
\\\
 By far my favorite Indian restaurant. Every thing I have tried here has been great. The only complaints I have is that the buffet is a little on the pricey side for a lunch buffet and some of the buffet items taste better when ordered a la cart. I have tried many other Indian restaurants and none of them compare to Crown. 
\\\
 I've been eating here(well, mostly taking out) for probably about 10 years, and it's been consistently terrific!...I tend to order the aloo papri chaat(potatoes, chickpeas, and crispies in a tangy raita[yogurt] sauce)...also, the samosas are perfection embodied--a little greasy, but crispy and well done on the outside, and full of potatoes, anise, and curry--delicious when dipped in the red and green chutneys! Recently, I've discovered the coconut soup(amazing on a Winter's day!)...it's sweet and warm...just incredible! also--don't miss the buffet--11-3 and $8 for all you can eat...there're samosas, aloo papri chaat, a variety of chicken dishes, fragrant basmati rice, and my favorite dessert--gulab jamun(dough balls soaked in milk and syrup and served warm)...very rich and soft... the atmosphere is intimate and beautiful, and the service has always been friendly--definitely one of my favorite eateries! 
\\\
 We were craving Myilai Masala, but it is a little bit of a trip, so we decided to go here, as it is right around the corner. We went for dinner and were the only people in the whole place. It felt awkward as it was only us and it was totally silent, there was no music playing. The food was pretty good. It's a good place to go when we don't feel like taking the trip to our favorite Indian restaurant. 
\\\
 After a nice hike/walk through the Plainsboro Preserve, my friends and I were getting hungry and so we found this place through a quick online search since we were craving Indian. What suck luck we were able to come across this place. We had their lunch buffet, which was really very good. I really hate when buffets (of any sort) have too many choices, none of which end up being any good, but Crown of India had at least 7-8 hot options along with the typical sides found in Indian restaurants- chutrneys, naan, rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, other sauces. All the dishes I had were really good and kept very warm. My favorite was their aloo gobi and their chicken makhni. The service was also wonderful. The owners (I presume) came by twice to ask us how we were enjoying the meal and were so friendly and eager to talk. Our empty plates were cleared off without asking, and our water glasses were never empty. This place is a little further away from me, which kind of sucks, but will be willing to come back again on a weekend. The buffet was also a little under 10.00- great deal on such wonderful food! 
\\\
 Agreeing with the previous reviewer. I lived in Plainsboro twice, totalling about 6 years, and this was an often visited restaurant. The mixed platter was a favorite, although we'd usually take the meat that was only OK and add it to the sauce of the fantastic chicken makhni. Samosas are really good, and always finish with their gulab jamun. Staff is really nice, decor is fine, and the buffet - although I haven't been in years - was always pretty busy during the week. Considering the ethnic makeup of Plainsboro, this is a great Indian restaurant to have locally, but people may not think of going to it because of it's strip-mall location. I definitely say give it a try if you're in the area! 
\\\
 This is my go-to Indian place in WWP area. Granted I get the same thing every time (Keema Naan and Lamb Rogan Josh) it's always good and well spiced. They also offer a very nice looking lunch buffet. 
\\\
 This place is amazing and we've been eating here for years. Since covid, I've been able to get it from Grubhub and it tastes just as good. 5 stars for sure. Normally get the non-vegetarian meal and it's perfect size and a great deal! 
\\\
 A most pleasant surprise. I haven't been here in many years and only came at the invitation of some old friends. The change of ownership, management, philosophy and menu moved this from a place that I'd only go upon invitation to a place that I'd go as a destination. The food was very good, the service - very professional and the friendliness of the owners - exceptional. The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 was that the portions of the entrees were satisfactory, but not exceptional. For an excellent meal with good prices and warm, friendly service, this is a new destination restaurant for us! 
\\\
 This place is amazing. We come here at least every other month. My favorite are the vegetarian dishes. I really recommend the paneer as well. 
\\\
 my family is really picky about Indian food, but we love this place. the food is tasty and fresh, and the buffet has so many options. the people who work here are really nice too. you can tell a lot of work goes into each dish- my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and dal. 
\\\
 A favorite of mine. Very nice owners. Love the food!!! Been going there for the last 4 years and the food is consistently good. 
\\\
 We hosted my sister's wedding reception at the Crown of India this past month, and it was a huge success!! Mr. Suggy, Brian, and the staff accommodated all of our requests (color scheme, theme, last minute center piece set up) and ensured that everything was ready by the time we got there. The guests loved the food and were very impressed with the space, décor, and how well organized they were overall! The service is very friendly and professional and everyone went to great lengths to ensure the party was enjoyable by all. We definitely recommend this place for any party!! 
\\\
 I'm very loyal to this restaurant because I've been coming here for almost a decade!!!! For a while it was almost like our second kitchen. So, I love it. Having said that, I must add that recently the food is not always consistent and sometimes it is hit-or-miss. I personally prefer the a-la-carte dinner or to order take-out to their buffet lunch. The service is always good and friendly. The decor is very tacky but I don't mind, because the food is usually very tasty and the prices reasonable (especially the buffet which is worth a try). 
\\\
 The food was very good. The only problem I had was with the waitress we had. She was bad at knowing what was on the menu, and brought out the wrong items several times. She blamed this on the fact that she had just started working there, but my brother and his girlfriend, who were with me, had been waited on by her 2 months before! Great food, but that particular waitress ruined the experience for me. 
\\\
 Craving Indian food that we did not have to make ourselves, a friend and I decided to give this establishment a try. We asked if the restaurant would allow us to split a special for one which included a choice of soup (we chose a chicken soup), an appetizer platter which included a kebab, tandoori chicken and vegetable pakora (similar to fried vegetables), a choice entree (we chose butter chicken), a daal entree (lentils), a choice dessert (we chose ras malai- a dessert made from indian cheese called paneer) and tea/coffee. The restaurant obliged and I feel may have even given us a portion greater than they would have normally given one person. The food was delicious- both flavorful and well prepared, and plentiful. The service was top notch. A man, who seemed to be the owner even came by and said hello and asked if he could get us anything. When we had eaten to our hearts content we still had food leftover and the restaurant kindly split it into two take home bags for us. We were thoroughly satisfied. The only complaint I have is that the masala chai was not an orange pekoe tea boiled with spices and milk that is standard at Indian restaurants, rather it seemed to be equivalent to chai tea as one would receive in a Starbucks. Being s huge fan of masala chai, I was disappointed about this. All in all however, we were thoroughly satisfied and will definitely return to this establishment. Thank you Crown of India, you made our day! 
\\\
 Best lamb korma, butter chicken, and other delicious items I've ever had. Thank you for being open during quarantine 
\\\
 I went here for dinner yesterday, for the first time in years. Why should I have? I can get great Indian food at my parents' house in Plainsboro. I have to say, lesson learned. The interior is beautiful, the food was wonderful, and the service was good. It was Sunday night and pouring, which might account for why it was almost empty, but just in case I'm writing this review. The owners are very very friendly and community-minded. We got dosas, puris, chicken shahi korma, raita, mango lassi, and the star: Goan fish curry with flounder. It was definitely far too much food for two, and we didn't expect one order of puri to be so large. The two curries were delicious, hot, and fresh. The raita and lassi were authentic and refreshing. The dosas were thin and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and came with sambar and a great coconut chutney. Everything came in beautiful dishes, which just enhanced the whole experience. It had the look and feel of a much more expensive place. I wanted to try almost everything on the menu. We also ended up with no room for dessert. I guess it's OK because we'll absolutely come back next week. In the meantime there are leftovers in the fridge that I can't wait to tackle. Finally: despite the lovely atmosphere, it might not be the best choice as a date place. We were far too busy eating to do any talking. 
\\\
 Very good food, great value! I love Indian food and found this to be one of the better ones. The food is good quality in good portions, and everything shows small original touches. The menu has lots of choices, and most dishes are $12 or under. Service was friendly, professional, and prompt. The restaurant itself is nice, very clean, and while nothing amazing, it had a nice warm ambiance. I ordered the food "spicy" and it came pretty medium-spicy (which is okay with me), but I'm a pasty white guy so that may influence their reading of spice. So if you want it hot, you may want to make that clear. The food was not only tasty, but everything showed that little extra touch that shows they take things seriously. We ordered a lamb naan which was large, fluffy, hot, and very good. The vegetable samosas were very good, and a little spicy. (so many places make them without the spice!) I ordered a lamb vindaloo and it was very yummy. My friend ordered a dish I hadn't even seen before - the menu was full of things like that, extra soups, desserts and drinks - much better than your average lunch-buffet Indian place. His dish was also tasty. I'd definitely recommend this place, and I'm thrilled that the price range means I can have it frequently. 
\\\
 Five stars for the dinner option, four stars for the lunch buffet. A lunch buffet is NEVER going to be as good as a personal meal, because 1) it's sitting out for an extended period of time, and 2) it's made to be as inoffensive (not-spicy) as possible so as to appeal to as many people as possible. The tika masala and saag paneer here are heavenly. I moved away and whenever I return to visit old friends I make it a point to eat here. 
\\\
 Very Good Indian Food... The Buffet offers an awesome selection, there is a deep menu with plenty to offer, fair prices and the wait staff are friendly. I'd recommend it anybody looking for high quality Indian food in the Princeton area. 
\\\
 I love it when, on rare occasions, I end up in Plainsboro at midday because it means I can go to Crown of India. The buffet is huge and the setting is very nice. However, since they upgraded the interior of the restaurant, the prices have been high enough to make me notice (but not high enough to keep me away). 
\\\
 Whenever we don't feel like cooking we get takeout from Crown of India. We've gotten their food maybe once a month for the past year. Always hot, big portions, and tasty. The naan is good. My MIL and I love the rice. We usually get the Aloo Gobi and Saag Paneer. These dishes are not AMAZING but definitely good enough that we get Crown of India cravings every once in a while that no other takeout can satisfy. I would recommend this place to others. Getting a dish from there is like settling into a warm dish of comfort food--Indian style. 
\\\
 Outstanding quality buffet lunch. The buffet has three sides - sauces, main dishes, and desserts. The paneer is wonderful and not squishy. Their tikka masala sauce is fantastic. Everything was fresh and hot. 
\\\
 The food is very good. The ambiance is appropriate for a better Indian restaurant. We had problem with the service. We could put up with unresponsive wait staff, but it was an incredibly long wait for the food. Only two or three tables were occupied so there is no logical explanation. All above notwithstanding the food is good enough to bring us back, (when we have a lot of time on hand) 
\\\
 Great food. Needs more variety. Seems that all I see for protein is chicken. Get some lamb or goat in there. Everything is very fresh and hot and they serve you Naan to you individually and it's hot and fresh! Very consistent. 
\\\
 This is an excellent restaurant. We visit every few months and the food is uniformly excellent including a newly introduced South Indian menu. The owner is friendly and informative, the service prompt and personable and the room casually elegant, quiet and conducive to easy conversation. 
\\\
 This place is great. The food is excellent and the staff is almost too nice. The cost is less than half of what I would expect it to be. 
\\\
 Went there on a date and Indian was exactly what we were craving on a brisk, autumn night. She had the chicken makhani and I had the lamb rogan josh and the dishes were great: the meat was tender and the curries they were prepared in were so deep and rich in flavor. The servers were so nice to us and were very attentive. I've also been there during the week for business lunch and their buffet is fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the the Mercer County area looking for authentic Indian cuisine. 
\\\
 I signed into yelp to write my first review just because this place is awesome. I've lived in NYC and SF and neither place has indian that can touch this strip mall joint. One place in Edison is just as good, I'll admit. Whenever I go I nearly injure myself eating so much because it's so delicious. Just as an example, their cauliflower is so perfectly cooked in the aloo gobi you can chew it with your *tongue*. Nice and quiet, spacious, unobtrusive and familiar service, underpriced. Even the decor is nice, with lots of carved wood. Go. Seriously. 
\\\
 only went here once- today- and had buffet. I like veggie dishes and this is a Northern Indian restarant, so I cannot comment on the meat items. Rice was basmati and nicely cooked...sambar and yellow dal were OK, but I could have had a bit more spice. Had a good alu gobi and the pav baji had fresh ginger slivers in it. Paneer mumtaz was quite sweet- was not expecting sweetness in the sauce but maybe others like that? Desert pudding was good, but missing some cardamom (I did finish every drop I took) . Owners/staff were very friendly and the restaurant itself was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. 
\\\
 Amazing!!! Our favorite Indian restaurant. Can be somewhat slow but always made just to order. If we have questions about the menu, the staff is always happy to help us. Never disappoints! 
\\\
 Very good lunch buffet. Not too many left. I have never been disappointed. Food is very good and they aren't looking to charge extra for naan. 
\\\
 Very delicious food, but the flies can be annoying and customer service is not the best, but the food is excellent. 
\\\
 Oh wow. You know it has to be good when an Indian family has their wedding reception here. Food quality is THE MOST important thing to the family. I'm on a South Indian vegetarian light course tonight. FLAVORS are mild and textures are fun! Staring with cracker and the oh so delicious 3 sauces. Syrupy and sweet, mint and tomato pickle. ++ Masala tea. Like chai wants to be. ++ plain dosa. Thin rice crepe served with sambar and coconut chutney. Delicious and light. ++ idly. Steamed rice and lentil patties. Cool. It feels like cornbread. ++ Uttapam. Rice pancakes with onion and spinach. ++ mango chutney. And of course... * raita. My favorite cool-me-down bowl of bitter yogurt and cucumber. Unfortunately this one has way too much pepper powder. Ugh. Totally hit the spot and I wasn't that hungry for not having eaten all day. Yum! Can't wait to come back! 
\\\
 I took my mother here for Mother's Day and we had an absolutely lovely time! The special lunch buffet they had was so delicious! So many options and just honestly good food. They had music playing which was nice and who I think was the owner kept coming to check on us which was so nice! He suggested we try the ice cream that is homemade at their other location and OMG IT WAS THE BEST. From that moment on for the rest of the day we literately couldn't stop talking about how amazing the mango and coconut ice cream was. And at the end the price was extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of food and attention that we had received. 10/10 would recommend. 
\\\
 This spot is great! Had fantastic food and it is very COVID friendly. They take temperatures as soon as you walk in and social distancing inside is very well organized. Will definitely come here again 10/10 recommend! 
\\\
 Great food, lovely ambience, and fantastic service. We ordered the vegetable samosa, garlic naan, aloo mutter, and baingan bharta, and we were very impressed with how quickly the food came out and how flavorful and delicious it was. Would highly recommend! 
\\\
 Impeccable preparation of the freshest food, & a very friendly & courteous waitstaff. Highly recommended. 
\\\
 I haven't written a review of Crown for some time. We still go every week and have never been disappointed with the food, or the service. When our family members visit from out of time, they always request a visit to Crown. 
\\\
 *** All was pleasant until towards the end of the meal, we witnessed the old white blonde woman who works the front register snapping at one of the wait staff. She did this in front of customers. Then I continued to witness her interactions with the employees and her attitude towards them was a bit nasty. This is really unfortunate and is the one reason I would not dine back here again. *** We were greeted and seated by a nice welcoming host who explained the buffet and menu options. He was kind enough to even walk my husband through the vegan options at the buffet. Food at the buffet was very good. Food was freshly made and had a variety of vegetarian as well as vegan options. We had the different rices, saag paneer, veggie coquettes, jalapeño poppers, chicken tikki masala, and many other dishes. We all went up for seconds! The young lady who served us was attentive and always had our waters refilled and took away our dishes once we were done. Price was affordable at $17 a person with gratuity. Came here with a party of 10. Instead of putting the tables straight in a line, it was an always L shape which was uncomfortable in a small space. It resulted for some of us faced towards the other tables while others had their backs to another. 
\\\
 Food isn't great. Tasted better at other restaurants. Not worth the price. Not much else to say 
\\\
 Food and the buffet was good. The service was good and had a lot of variety. Will visit again 
\\\
 I have been eating there and ordering from them for three years . The food is amazing and the service is great. They are a family restaurant and I love that . I have never witnessed anyone snapping at staff, but the woman the other yelper was harsh about must have had an off day. It's a family restaurant, and families do argue sometimes. So I never judge going to restaurants by that. I always go by the food and service, and both are great! 
\\\
 This is my go-to Indian takeout restaurant! Great portions, great taste. The workers are always pleasant when I pick up my food as well! 
\\\
 Food was so good. This was my first time trying Indian and I will definitely be back. Delicious and fresh. The owner kept stopping by our table to make suggestions and make us laugh. What a great establishment. 
\\\
 We used the facility for a college reunion of around 30 folks. The event was held in their "Jaipur Room" banquet hall. The banquet hall is very nice and tastefully decorated. The seating arrangement was elegant and enabled good flow of people and wait staff. They also had decent audio-visual capabilities. Central audio with wireless mic and a flat screen tv with aux input. The hall has reasonable acoustics. The buffet spread consisted of three apps, 4 main entrees, 2 desserts, breads, and rice. It's a BYOB and they provided the wine and beer glassware. The hostess was very pleasant and the wait-staff was very professional. The owner himself came by to introduce himself in the very beginning - a good sign of things to come. The gathering loved the food and the ambience. We really pulled off a very good event - thanks in large part to the Crown of India staff. Last but not the least, WiFi was provided and it worked quite well! 
\\\
 This was my first time at the restaurant. Amazing food! Such great flavor. And, the service was very friendly. The waitresses and owner kept us comfortable, happy and well fed. We ordered the non-vegetable platter for an appetizer; and, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, chicken korma and tandoori chicken for a meal. It fed the four of us very well and again was delicious. BYOB was an added bonus! We will definitely come back often! The buffet set up for lunch looks incredible... :) 
\\\
 BEST Indian restaurant. Used to come all the time when I lived in Hightstown and since moving to Philly I haven't found anything nearly as good. Often drive from Philly just to come to this spot. Owner is really lovely and accommodating, food is perfectly spicy and fresh--no extra oil or grease! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! 
\\\
 This was a great buffet with good food, a nice seating area, and a great price! The food was a little salty but it was being prepared freshly at a consistent rate and tasted very good! 
\\\
 Excellent food, attentive service (on most occasions), and an adorable owner who likes to make the rounds. 
\\\
 Very good food, had the dinner for two. Tandoori was excellent and had eggplant, chicken tiki. Service a little slow with a few large parties and take out on a Friday night. Would recommend this Indian food, the medium spice wa right on, not too spicy but just right 
\\\
 Excellent experience. Beautiful and Clean. Lovely service and the food is the BEST Indian food Ev-Ver. We have never been disappointed. Five Stars not enough IMHO 
\\\
 Great food! This is the one restaurant that specializes in both North and South Indian cooking. The Masala dosa was awesome, and the whole chicken tandoori was a huge hit. Someone below mentioned they have the best tandoori chicken in NJ, I concur. It is the best! The customer service is great too and they packed my to go order very neatly and carefully to avoid any spills on the ride home. Will definitely be ordering again! 
\\\
 We were just in town for the day and while driving home we decided to stop by at Crown of India for dinner. We ended up getting the the dinner for 2 option. This had so many different courses and they were all delicious. The service was great and we were able to take a lot of food to go because we were stuffed by the main course. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone! 
\\\
 We came to this restaurant on a Thursday night. The service and food was amazing. Mr. Suggy gave us service with a smile. I ordered a Bhindi Masala and my friends got the Tikka Masala (chicken) and Chicken Mango. The food was excellent. I will definitely be back. 
\\\
 Had dinner there with my son last night. No Indian food for last 10 years. It was terrific! Chicken dish creamy and sweet -special bread soft and warm. Nice friendly atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!! 
\\\
 Love this place. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and most importantly delicious food. I also like how it is BYOD. This is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant in the area. 
\\\
 Really like the pakora, but all the food is good. The food is a little on the spicy side in a good way. 
\\\
 Love this amazing Indian cuisine . My family and I have been dining here for years . Excellent service - the best food ! Wonderful Sunday buffets! 
\\\
 I've dined at Crown of India's lunch buffet half a dozen times and while it may not be mind blowing in it's complexity,authenticity or taste....It'll do. I like Thursdays when a excellent array of Samosas is offered as well as their Tandoori chicken and Lamb korma. The buffet is tended and refilled regularly so nothing is left half empty or dried and while all their dishes are seasoned well don't expect any heat...not even a little but understandable considering that their lunch crowd is half non Asian, I'm in the habit of asking for a small bowl of raw chilies to balance some of the dishes out. Service can be a bit slow as plates tend to pile up but rushing an Indian meal is never advisable so try different combinations,enjoy your meal and at under $12.00 a head, it is still a good lunch alternative to what is available in Plainsboro.. 
\\\
 Since I can remember, we have been dining at Crown of India, and prior, to the restaurants which the owner previously had. Dining at COI is as if you're dining at your own home. I have hosted several events, either at COI, or where they catered the food for my event, and it was great. Most recently, they catered the food for my wedding & reception; everyone enjoyed thoroughly. They take pride in their cooking & presentation! Def. go check them out! 
\\\
 Stopped in on our way though NJ. We are originally from North Jersey and headed to VA. We had a lot of Indian food, and this was one of the best. Even though we came at 215 and the buffet closes at 230 they let us load up on food and sit to eat. Lots of Indian places close down after lunch buffet but this one technically doesn't. Nice touch. They had a good selection of dishes from Goat to Masala to Aloo and veggie Korma. The naan was great. Service was great. The restaurant is clean. 
\\\
 My exploration of Indian joints in the West Windsor/Plainsboro area continues. This mostly occurs once a year when I'm home at my parents for Thanksgiving and looking for food with high school friends Thanksgiving day. What we've learned is that only Indian and Chinese places are open Thanksgiving day. So this year we checked out Crown of India. Overall it's okay, but I probably won't be back. Palace of Asia in Lawrenceville still take the top spot in the area for me. So back to Crown of India. The buffet is good, but nothing special. Some of the dishes felt a bit stale. Especially the fried foods which were no longer crunchy and instead a bit soggy. 
\\\
 This review is about their take-out. I got their paneer mumtaz, garlic naan, and mango lassi. I ordered medium spicy for the paneer, and it was on the spicier side but I like that. The taste was delicious and they were generous with the paneer cubes! The garlic naan was tasty, as was the mango lassi. I was very happy with my order and I'll definitely order from them again next time I'm craving Indian. 
\\\
 Crown of India is one of the best Indian restaurant in NJ/NY/Philly. Been to a lot of Indian places and their food is very authentic and the service is amazing. The owner Mr. Suggy is the best and he takes care of everyone. Their New Year's party was simply outstanding. very well organized and food was yummy 
\\\
 I am writing this review because I came to this restaurant at closing time. And the owner instead of rejecting, he served me food. I ordered chicken malai and butter naan. The chicken pieces were very soft, I would rate them 10/10 and the whole chicken malai would get 9/10. Naan were not that great. I would give it 6or7/10. Overall experience was great. The lighting, seating and art, the whole experience was like I am siting in a high end restaurant in India. I would recommend this place to other to try once at least. I have read the old reviews because of them I wasn't going to but because of restaurant being near to my location I came here. Don't know about veg food neither about other dishes. 
\\\
 I came here for a private party in November. The appetizers and entrees were delicious!! I don't usually go out for Indian food, but compared to others, this food was amazing. 
\\\
 Great restaurant, and delicious food. I had the veggie korma and I ate almost all of it (which is impressive for me) Wonderful and sweet owner, keep up the good work boss! 
\\\
 !Take the CROWN OF INDIA vs. New Chilli & Curry challenge. Diwan is my personal favorite.. but New Chilli has led this town with more reviews with a cult like following.. so try it for yourself! I find this more traditional, subtle and really good. As its right on strip mall..its not a sultry exotic Indian restaurant meant to impress your date on the weekend. But it is big, new inside and nice wood accents and a more modern vibe..This is one competitive town for ranking in Indian cuisine. At CROWN the chefs have talent. also landlord for the adjoining store so will likely be there awhile and seems to be able to keep standards high.efficient place.. alert young well dressed hosts, Heat was medium range... the stated goal of Indian chefs has always been to blend spices so than no one flavor stands out more than the others.. they do this .. they get this right. we had chicken korma (casew gravy with chicken) a must have ..it was perfectly well cooked a bit dense.. not dried and fresh.. saw goat, why are we carnivores? But its a favorite and was clearly just made.. with the right dark sauce.. I'm not a lentil fan.. they're ok.. but I usually head past them.. but I did like two lentil based dishes one Dal was yellow colored and savory, also liked the mixed rice... The chicken tandoori was done perfectly, yogurt sauce, onion and lemon available... what else wowed.. the naan/ roti just ok - Surprisingly the three star rated kochi kerala restaurant leads in naan... Super naan there. We're NY'ers and LI'ers.. so we often just keep moving to the next place.. little loyalty from seasoned Yelpers.. next please.. unless something intrigues a bit... or is where you want to be... hard to do at an Indian buffet.. but I did find myself saying the next day.. should we go back? So it's good enough to return. CROWN OF INDIA WAS GREAT EXPERIENCE.. 
\\\
 I've eaten at this restaurant more times than I can count and I'm never disappointed! My family and I go there for dinner and get take out fairly regularly. The malai kofta and paneer mumtaz are particularly loved and their hulwa is delicious. Although it's predominantly north Indian curries, they added a south Indian menu a few years ago so you can order dosa, uttupam, and a few other dishes. Always a delicious choice of restaurant! 
\\\
 Tried takeout from this place. We ordered: vegetable samosas, palak paneer, vegetable korma, chicken tikka masala and a few orders of naan. Everything was nicely packed and we also received utensils and plates as well. The food was tasty and was a nice foray for those in the group that was not familiar with Indian food. It was a bit mild in spice and flavor, but that suited our group well. The samosas came with two little containers of chutney sauces (sweet tamarind and a spicy cilantro/mint green one). The vegetable korma was chock full of nuts and vegetables, which made it quite hearty. The chicken tikka masala had a very strong, sharp tomato flavor and had onions in it, which is very different from other renditions of this dish where it had more of a creamy overtone to it. Still satisfying. in general, a nice beginner place to go to for those who are unsure about Indian food. Apparently, once a month they hold religious service. So it was interesting to hear the prayer service while waiting for the food to be ready. I was surprised how large this place is. There are a few rooms that look like they can be privately rented out for various occasions. Very nice atmosphere.

 My wife and I really like Indian food and are always on the look out for a restaurant in our area that we would like we'll enough to patronize on a repeat basis. We stumbled upon *The Crown of India* last night while shopping, decided to try it and were delighted. We especially enjoyed the Baingan Bharta (eggplant), chicken Tikka Marsalis and vegetable Biriyani. Service was excellent and the proprietor very friendly.

 There's a million Indian places in central jersey, but none as consistent in taste, quality and experience as this. Everything my family and I have had off of this menu has been wonderful and flavorful. And the best part- when you say medium spice, you get medium spice. That perfect level of a slight kick but not too overpowering, and not bland at all. Too many other places will give you creamy, bland food when you say medium. This place gets it just right! :)

 Excellent experience. We had a function there on a busy Saturday with many adults and children. The business was responsive and they made the function excellent. They brought the food on time and there was plenty of it. The food was terrific and the staff was very good and helpful. I would highly recommend the restaurant! 
\\\
 Excellent food! Best indian food I had have in my life. Went with my husband, been there a couple of times, we are never disappointed. Best ethnic restaurant, food is awesome, and the attention is also really good.

 Service- impeccable. My friend and i went in there as a last minute stop before our 7 hr journey back to VA. We didnt have huge appetites, so we asked our server if we could take the meal that was supposed to be for one person , and split it. He was nice enough to ask and we got to split our meal. We were served everything separately- so our soup was brought out into two bowls, so was our meal, dessert, etc. It was convenient and appreciated. Our food came out in decent time - less than 15 min) Food- id give the food a 3 stars- i guess im comparing it to iselin ( little india) and it falls a little off that. HOWEVER, it really is the best food in the p-boro, west windsor area! The owner was really nice, came to check up on us multiple times. Our butter chicken was flavorful, naan was fresh, rice didnt taste so fresh but was still really good! My friend's masala chai wasnt really masala chai indian style- it was a masala chai teabag- which was really weird and unexpected. She didnt seem to care for it as she was expecting it desi style ( boiled with spices and all). Our rasmali was thick and YUM! My family comes here often, so i will definitely return! Good bang for your buck and the ambiance is great for a first date or family outing!

 As I told them while I was there this past Friday, this place is, "SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!" The food was absolutely fantastic! Even better, the service was phenomenal! If you're looking for great Indian food in a really nice atmosphere this is your place. My friend and I did the 2 person special they had that day. If they have it while you're there I'd highly recommend it. It came with a ton of food! If you're new to Indian cuisine and not sure what to get I'd suggest starting with Korma. It's very mild on spice, but still extremely tasty! If you like spice make sure to order at least Medium Plus as your spice level. I really can't wait to go again! See you again soon, Crown of India!

 Buffet was on point. Only been there once but it has been a good experience so far. Buffet is fairly priced and comes with your standard Indian buffet food options. One good thing I liked was that the naan was brought to your table fresh from the kitchen. 
\\\
 This is for take out only . my job ordered from here and decided to tag along They have a decent lunch special $7 for chicken tikka masala , rice, salad , dhal and naan. Not my favorite chicken tikka masala but it wasn't bad . The naan was good. 
\\\
 quality indian food at an amazing price. lunch buffet is a steal with a huge variety of choices. continually impressed with this place! fresh naan from the kitchen always with your order. 
\\\
 They have the best chicken makani in the area, they use dark meat chicken, but the sauce is even better. For veggie people, try out the saag paneer. Been coming here since the mid 90s, place is legit 
\\\
 I was there for the first time, got there around 1pm. Food tasted decent, not spicy. Creamy dishes are good. Flavor are sophisticated. However, most dishes have been sitting there since 11 am, and most are stale. both batura and naan are soft and hard to chew, and pakora and other fried items has turned very soft. For the price of 12 bucks, they can do a little better. I think they have good potential, Maybe food would be better over the weekend with frequent turnover rate. I ordered baigan bortha to go and it was made to order, very good. Will try again 
\\\
 Amazing food! The paneer makhani was delicious! Loved this place. Definitely recommend it. 
\\\
 Very well rounded menu. Ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter, fish tikka and mattar paneer. When you sit down you get dosas and chutney right away. The batter on the fried apps was a little thick for my tastes, but still good. The appetizers will fill you up fast so beware. The fish tikka was excellent. Marinated and cooked in the tandor it was charred on spots but surprisingly moist. I definitely recommend it. The matter paneer was in a very thick cream sauce. I couldn't eat too much since it was so thick. I would avoid the heavy cream dishes upon returning. The bill wasn't terrible. Atmosphere was nice enough. The bf was very amused that the plates & glasses had crowns embossed on them. It's a byob, and there is a liquor store in this plaza if you are in a pinch. I'll definitely be returning.

 I grew up in Plainsboro and remember when Crown of India first opened in 1990. There weren't many Indian restaurants in the area, so to have one in our own backyard was a treat. Fast forward 28 years and Indian restaurants are a dime a dozen in the Central New Jersey area. Although Crown of India switched ownership a few years back, their food quality has remained consistent throughout the years. I have been here several times for private events, buffet lunches and many dinners. My family has even had food catered for private parties. I have rarely (if ever) left disappointed with the quality of food. On a recent visit, the Saag Paneer along with the Chicken Tikka were both exceptional. The prices are very reasonable and the service was pleasant. The owner came to check on us and ask how we enjoyed our meal. He presented us with a $10 Crown Cash certificate for spending $50.

 Went here for dinner with my wife a few weeks ago. There were a few large private parties going on and the dining room was moderately busy, a good sign. We were quite hungry and indecisive so we ordered one meat Thali and one vegetarian Thali. It was a lot of food, and pretty reasonable considering that desert and masala chai were included with each one. The appetizers that came out for each Thali were delicious, although the coconut soup was just so-so. The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were moist and succulent, as was the seekh kebab. Veg starter was a samosa big enough for two, freshly prepared and tasty (you could tell it was fried to order and not reheated, but this usually depends on how busy they are with most Indian restaurants). Mains were all great, served with freshly baked naans, great dal, and plenty of good, real basmati rice. We had a lamb curry and 4 veg dishes, and all were tasty and well spiced, but as always with Northern cooking, a bit on the rich side. After dinner, the presumed owner, a Sikh, came around and asked us how the food was, and even came and brought us masala chai himself. Gulab jamun was served hot, and even though we were stuffed we gobbled it down. All in all, we found it to be an enjoyable and reasonably priced north Indian meal. Some reviewers complained about the quality of idlis and other south Indian foods here. I am not surprised they were not good. This is a north Indian place. Go elsewhere for dosa and sambar etc. In fact, there is a South Indian cafe in the same shopping center that has dosa, iddli, utapams and more that I am meaning to try. 
\\\
 Fantastic food. Not sure why so many folks have only given 3 stars. Would definitely come again! 
\\\
 Restaurant was good, I ordered from the lunch menu and my friend paid for the lunch buffet. Buffet price was a LITTLE steep at $12.95, but it's not terrible. According to my friend, buffet food was good, choices were many but not common or super popular items. She wished there were more meat items on the buffet option. Desert was good. As for myself, my masala dosa was tasty and fresh, and filled with the potato onion filling. Served warm and fresh was a good flavor overall. Would definitely go back! 
\\\
 Great place love their food did a party here Brian and Sugey are a great help. Love the food and a helpful staff. Great job guys! 
\\\
 Solid Indian food-tasty, ever reliable quality and top notch service. 
\\\
 Love this place. 9.99 buffets before COVID-19 and good entrées for pick up and delivery. Great job Crown of India. 
\\\
 Yummy food. Very friendly staff. I love the tikka Marsala. The dosa is excellent too! My friends and I go at least once a month for dinner. 
\\\
 This is my favorite place for Indian when I'm home in Plainsboro. I usually like to get vegetable samosas, saag paneer, and garlic naan. Can't really speak to the dining-in experience but they have very quick and delicious takeout. Only downside is it's a little pricier than other places I've been to. 
\\\
 We went to this shopping center for Malaysia food, but too many people there, so we changed to Crown of India in the same shopping center. It was far better than we expected. Buffet food was very tasty, naan bread was soft. The restaurant is neat and the deco is very nice. We had very good experience, no complaint at all. Definitely we will go back there. 
\\\
 I have been here the past two years for Diwali dinner; the atmosphere for these events was great: music, dancing, fun atmosphere. The food for this event was buffet style, and everything was excellent (especially the goat curry, pineapple rasam, and some eggplant dish I can't remember the name of). The service was good; the owner was very friendly, came around and asked how everything was, talked a bit. Would recommend, and would highly recommend for any of the special/holiday dinners. 
\\\
 Really enjoy this place... Food has always been delicious, pleasant service, and great prices. Also, the owner always makes an effort to drop in to each table. I usually get chicken tikka masala which is always very flavorful with very tender chicken. Last night I got the lamb korma which was sweet (coconut), creamy, and spicy (asked for medium spice, next time will get mild)- very good.... My brother got the vegetarian platter for one which was an awesome way to try different dishes and all three he chose were great- favorite was the vegetable malai kofta. Overall, great food, laid back atmosphere, and good prices. Definitely recommend! 
\\\
 I've been going here for years. The food is great. And if you host a party here the staff is wonderful and accommodating. I recommend the chicken or paneer makhani chicken tandoori and any of the daals or veg dishes. 
\\\
 The food is generally good, but kinda pricey. 
\\\
 Great service and food. I've never been there during a busy time so not sure how the service is when they're packed. Been there twice now and service was personal and friendly and food was delicious. Reasonably priced for dinner.
