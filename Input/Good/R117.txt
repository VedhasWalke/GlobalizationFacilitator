I'm very loyal to this restaurant because I've been coming here for almost a decade!!!!   For a while it was almost like our second kitchen.   So, I love it.  Having said that, I must add that recently the food is not always consistent and sometimes it is hit-or-miss.  I personally prefer the a-la-carte dinner or to order take-out to their buffet lunch.  The service is always good and friendly.   The decor is very tacky but I don't mind, because the food is usually very tasty and the prices reasonable (especially the buffet which is worth a try).
