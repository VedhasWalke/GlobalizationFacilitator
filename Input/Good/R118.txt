The food was very good. The only problem I had was with the waitress we had. She was bad at knowing what was on the menu, and brought out the wrong items several times. She blamed this on the fact that she had just started working there, but my brother and his girlfriend, who were with me, had been waited on by her 2 months before! Great food, but that particular waitress ruined the experience for me.
