Craving Indian food that we did not have to make ourselves, a friend and I decided to give this establishment a try. We asked if the restaurant would allow us to split a special for one which included a choice of soup (we chose a chicken soup), an appetizer platter which included a kebab, tandoori chicken and vegetable pakora (similar to fried vegetables), a choice entree (we chose butter chicken), a daal entree (lentils), a choice dessert (we chose ras malai- a dessert made from indian cheese called paneer) and tea/coffee. The restaurant obliged and I feel may have even given us a portion greater than they would have normally given one person. The food was delicious- both flavorful and well prepared, and  plentiful. The service was top notch. A man, who seemed to be the owner even came by and said hello and asked if he could get us anything. When we had eaten to our hearts content we still had food leftover and the restaurant kindly split it into two take home bags for us. We were thoroughly satisfied. The only complaint I have is that the masala chai was not an orange pekoe tea boiled with spices and milk that is standard at Indian restaurants, rather it seemed to be equivalent to chai tea as one would receive in a Starbucks. Being s huge fan of masala chai, I was disappointed about this. All in all however, we were thoroughly satisfied and will definitely return to this establishment. Thank you Crown of India, you made our day!
