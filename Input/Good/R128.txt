The food is very good. The ambiance is appropriate for a better Indian restaurant. We had problem with the service. We could put up with unresponsive wait staff, but it was an incredibly long wait for the food. Only two or three tables were occupied so there is no logical explanation. All above notwithstanding the food is good enough to bring us back, (when we have a lot of time on hand)
