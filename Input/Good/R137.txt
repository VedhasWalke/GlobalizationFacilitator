I signed into yelp to write my first review just because this place is awesome. I've lived in NYC and SF and neither place has indian that can touch this strip mall joint. One place in Edison is just as good, I'll admit. Whenever I go I nearly injure myself eating so much because it's so delicious. Just as an example, their cauliflower is so perfectly cooked in the aloo gobi you can chew it with your *tongue*. Nice and quiet, spacious, unobtrusive and familiar service, underpriced. Even the decor is nice, with lots of carved wood. Go. Seriously.
