only went here once- today- and had buffet. I like veggie dishes and this is a Northern Indian restarant, so I cannot comment on the meat items. Rice was basmati and nicely cooked...sambar and yellow dal were OK, but I could have had a bit more spice. Had a good alu gobi and the pav baji had fresh ginger slivers in it. Paneer mumtaz was quite sweet- was not expecting sweetness in the sauce but maybe others like that? Desert pudding was good, but missing some cardamom (I did finish every drop I took) . Owners/staff were very friendly and the restaurant itself was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated.
