I have been eating there and ordering from them for three years . The food is amazing and the service is great. They are a family restaurant and I love that . I have never witnessed anyone snapping at staff, but the woman the other yelper was harsh about must have had an off day. It's a family restaurant, and families do argue sometimes. So I never judge going to restaurants by that. I always go by the food and service, and both are great!
