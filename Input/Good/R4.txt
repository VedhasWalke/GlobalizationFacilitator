Great food! This is the one restaurant that specializes in both North and South Indian cooking. The Masala dosa was awesome, and the whole chicken tandoori was a huge hit. Someone below mentioned they have the best tandoori chicken in NJ, I concur. It is the best! The customer service is great too and they packed my to go order very neatly and carefully to avoid any spills on the ride home. Will definitely be ordering again!
