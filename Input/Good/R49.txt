Since I can remember, we have been dining at Crown of India, and prior, to the restaurants which the owner previously had. Dining at COI is as if you're dining at your own home. I have hosted several events, either at COI, or where they catered the food for my event, and it was great. Most recently, they catered the food for my wedding & reception; everyone enjoyed thoroughly. They take pride in their cooking & presentation! Def. go check them out!
