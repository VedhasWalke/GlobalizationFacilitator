Stopped in on our way though NJ. We are originally from North Jersey and headed to VA. We had a lot of Indian food, and this was one of the best.

Even though we came at 215 and the buffet closes at 230 they let us load up on food and sit to eat. Lots of Indian places close down after lunch buffet but this one technically doesn't. Nice touch.

They had a good selection of dishes from Goat to Masala to Aloo and veggie Korma. The naan was great. Service was great. The restaurant is clean.
