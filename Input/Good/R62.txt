There's a million Indian places in central jersey, but none as consistent in taste, quality and experience as this. Everything my family and I have had off of this menu has been wonderful and flavorful.

And the best part- when you say medium spice, you get medium spice. That perfect level of a slight kick but not too overpowering, and not bland at all. Too many other places will give you creamy, bland food when you say medium. This place gets it just right! :)
