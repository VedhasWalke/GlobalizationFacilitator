Very well rounded menu.  Ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter, fish tikka and mattar paneer.  When you sit down you get dosas and chutney right away.  The batter on the fried apps was a little thick for my tastes, but still good.   The appetizers will fill you up fast so beware.   The fish tikka was excellent.   Marinated and cooked in the tandor it was charred on spots but surprisingly moist.  I definitely recommend it.   The matter paneer was in a very thick cream sauce.  I couldn't eat too much since it was so thick.  I would avoid the heavy cream dishes upon returning.   The bill wasn't terrible.   Atmosphere was nice enough.   The bf was very amused that the plates & glasses had crowns embossed on them.  It's a byob,  and there is a liquor store in this plaza if you are in a pinch.   I'll definitely be returning.
