This is my favorite place for Indian when I'm home in Plainsboro. I usually like to get vegetable samosas, saag paneer, and garlic naan. Can't really speak to the dining-in experience but they have very quick and delicious takeout. Only downside is it's a little pricier than other places I've been to.
