I have been here the past two years for Diwali dinner; the atmosphere for these events was great: music, dancing, fun atmosphere.

The food for this event was buffet style, and everything was excellent (especially the goat curry, pineapple rasam, and some eggplant dish I can't remember the name of). The service was good; the owner was very friendly, came around and asked how everything was, talked a bit.

Would recommend, and would highly recommend for any of the special/holiday dinners.
