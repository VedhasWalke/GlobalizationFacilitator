 very fast food style

///

Yelp takeout and delivery is the worst ever! Super slow, more expensive than ordering on their website, and can't even cancel the order!! This is unbelievable, and I'll never use Yelp order services.

///

Walked in at 9 when they close at 11 to buy food sat down to eat and the worker told my friends and i that they were closed... mind you there was a bigger group of people just talking and bullshitting. Basically lied to us and told us to leave when people were still there eating.

///

Very disappointed in this place. Restaurant looked cool from the outside. We ordered tacos and a quesadilla. The quesadilla was extremely tiny and the tacos came with just a tortilla and meat on top. When we asked for lettuce tomato and cheese we were laughed at by the cashier. Unfriendly service, bad overpriced food makes this a one star review. Figure it out Tacoria.

///

This place is doomed. Expensive.  Carbo heavy.  Horchata excessively sweet.  Inattentive staff.  A cashier was doing yoga poses on the floor during slow periods.  Did she was her hands?  Doubtful.  This place is doomed.  An poorly designed order please correct up area. This place is doomed.

Ordered Pollo Asado Burrito for dinner today. Taste was bland and not flavorful. Upon checking menu, the burrito that I got did not have the included salsa. I requested for a replacement. Manager declined my request. Just told me there's salsa in the condiment table. Really? Didn't want to argue. Poor service.

///

Ordered two carne asada burritos and one al pastor with no dairy. We received one carne asada no salsa or crema, one chicken something no salsa or crema and one al pastor no dairy no salsa. So bland and disappointing!

///

This place has high reviews but to me honestly it's just an ok place.  I feel like most of the people that have visited this place and "love it" because they so used to going to Taco Bell and they try a new place and all of the sudden is the best unauthentic Mexican place ever lol .  Not a bad place but definitely not the best, been there twice and it was my last choice

///

I'm sorry, I tried. I really tried with this place. I wanted to like it, the decor seemed enticing, until you enter and find dirty tables that haven't been cleaned...anyways,  this place was recommended to me by a friend, and so I tried it out. I ordered the chicken tacos (asked for the least spicy option), the Brussels sprouts and the golden avocado appetizers. It was a royal mess. I think this place believes that if they make all their food extremely spicy, to point of being unbearable to eat, that no one will notice this is not authentic Mexican food, nor does it have any flavor, besides "extremely spicy"...

Well, my first visit was disappointing, however they stay open later than other places, so one night, I decided to be brave and try it again...

I went directly to the cashier and explained my issues the last time I was there and asked him to recommend the least spicy option they have available, and he replied that only the pork was made with less "spice" (whatever this mystery pepper may be that they douse their meat in)... I told him I preferred chicken, at which he then suggested to have it without the salsa (which he claimed was the item that made the meat spicy)...

I got my chicken quesadilla, and with about 2 bites, my tongue started swelling up. I chugged a bottle of water and then chomped on a cup of ice.

My health is not worth this food, honestly, if you prefer spicy food ( if you are one of those people) then this is the place for you!

Otherwise, If you prefer to taste the savory flavors of your meal, you may want to skip this place ... maybe try the Qdoba nearby if you really are in the mood for "Mexican" food

I'm sorry, like I said, I really wanted to like this place, I tried 2x, but your food just isn't that good and my poor mouth doesn't deserve to get burned by your food to this extent.

I would pass on this place if you're in the area... try Jules pizza around the corner or Princeton Soup & Sandwhich (but they close early, so check the time before you go )

///

As a native San Diegan, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food. That being said, I wanted to cut Princeton some slack and try the local and quite popular Tex-Mex joint. The interior of the restaurant is definitely trying to feel like a build your own street food place- Chipotle meets food truck style. I ordered the golden avocado mission style burrito without cheese and crema and was pretty disappointed after hearing rave reviews from locals about the burritos. They grilled the outside which certainly added much needed texture but made the taste of the tortilla overpowering. I am also not sure how they can ruin avocado. The rice was undercooked and lacking flavor just like the beans. They did have a good chipotle sauce that added some flavor but could not save the burrito in the end. I will not be coming back...

///

Sauce is too sweet! A bit expensive for the quality.  Dont know how long the novelty will last.

///

Made plans to try this place twice and haven't been able to get in. The line is out the door and it's an anxiety attack waiting to happen the minute you step foot inside. Get a bigger space, you are losing customers!!

///

Not worth it.
The burrito bowl I got (fried avocado) was ... meh. Ok. Drenched with too much sauce (chipotle and sour cream) on top. It was much less food than I would get in a Qdoba or Chipotle bowl or burrito. Also, they charge for any additions, unlike Qdoba or Chipotle. For example, a little pico de gallo added or a tortilla on the side of your bowl is an extra $0.50. Without additions my burrito bowl came out to $9.06 with tax.

///


I ordered the litmus test of burritos - the Al Pastor.

It was white rice, black beans and pork - but nothing else?

No greens, no choice of vegetables or any other fixing.

Kinda a led zeppelin.

///

I got a burrito bowl with brussels sprouts (a weird choice, but see above--they were out of most things. I wanted rajas, and settled for sprouts).  I wanted to like this place because I want there to be a decent taco place in town.  Alas.  This Texan will just keep cranking out my own tortillas at home, I guess.

///

we didn't care for the tacos too much. Something about the tortillas just wasn't right maybe just a little too dry for our taste.
