My wife and I just had dinner tonight at the Blue Point Grill in Princeton. It really exceeded our expectations. We were thinking about eating outside on their patio area which they said was heated. We were a little wary since it was only in the low fifties but we took a chance and were greatly surprised. We made a reservation the same day for 4:15 on the patio.  We were able to park close by with no problem.  Our great hostess seated us up on the second floor. She turned on the heating tower alongside our table and we are able to take our jackets off and were perfectly comfortable. Our wonderful server, Virginia, took great care of us and started us off with the Maine Lobster bisque. It was delicious with generous chunks of lobster in the bisque. My wife had the Filet Mignon with crab cakes. I had the Filet Mignon with lobster tail. This combination was not on the menu but Virginia said it was no problem. Our meals were great and our server was great.  We live only two towns north of Princeton so we look forward to going back soon.

BYOB. Right next to a liquor store which is convenient. food is really good and nice heated outside seating.

We were extremely pleased with Bluepoint Grill. All aspects of our visit were exceptional, from the menu choices to the service, to the entrées. Food quality was outstanding, extremely fresh and flavorful.

Last night my wife and I went to Blue Point Grill for an early dinner.  With the covid issue in play we had not been here for quite a while.  Blue Point Grill has not lost a step.  I had the Icelandic Cod and garlic mash while my Queen had the Grouper Medallions with the garlic mash.  We shared a Ceasar Salad and Jalapeno-Lime Shrimp app. Dessert was cheesecake and Keylime pie. All were great.  Service was terrific.  All in all a pleasant evening.  Highly recommend you visit here.

///

Always on point (no pun intended).  Top notch food and service.  Best seafood - always consistent quality and serving

///

My favorite restaurant in Princeton! They have the absolute best Sea bass I've ever had.  All of their fish is so fresh and I would recommend anything on the menu but definitely order the sea bass. It's also BYOB and I love the vibe here. Great outdoor seating and dog friendly.

///

I ate there twice, they don't know me, I am not a regular but I ordered mussels, they were great with wine sauce. The Swordfish was good, the most important part was someone I know.  Someone I have known since freshman year, I cannot lie to my running back, my friend, my teammate, my classmate and the only person who hit me with one punch, and I had respect for because as freshman I threw the first punch.  4 years of football, " the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat! " That is why I don't like eating alone and if I am with someone they better not be fake, they know my harsh tongue if crossed! I wish I could come more often, but she is gone and it will this time to hard to replace you don't forget your first meaningful kiss on the lips!

Awesome meal, wait staff (Carlos was wonderful). This restaurant is doing everything right with safety and social distancing. We had a variety of different dishes including clam chowder, lobster bisque. Both soups were good. Not spectacular. The octopus was nicely served and charred but I would have liked a few additional spices added. The tuna poke was fabulous and will get that again without sharing. We finally shared the crab cakes dinner. Crab cakes were great, and filled with crab but again, nothing out of the ordinary. All in all, this place has great food and will always be back!!

///

We had wanted to try this restaurant before Covid and tried it yesterday for curbside pickup. The jalapeño lime shrimp appetizer was absolutely incredible. Not too spicy, and just the right amount of citrus flavor. My daughter and I loved the crab cakes. Seared perfectly and not too much filler. We both had the rice and I enjoyed the cole slaw and a salad. My husband had the grilled shrimp dinner and could have ordered another serving of shrimp. We were very impressed -- for it to be this good when reheated for curbside pickup, it must be even better when it's served fresh at the restaurant. We can't wait to try more items off their menu.

I have been going to the Blue Point Grill for several years and my husband and I chose to visit for our first COVID meal out. Made a reservation online, and were seated up on the roof. The seats were comfortable, and real tableware is appreciated (vs paper/plastic). Our waitress was super nice and helpful despite the challenge of having to go up and down the stairs all night. Food was excellent, if you are going to pay a premium for something, pay for the best fish. We shared guacamole with crab (big lumps) and NE clam chowder. To be honest, the crab kind of got lost in the guacamole flavor, but it was tasty. Chowder is a solid rendition of the classic, not overly thickened. Entrees were two of the specials, bronzino filet with miso butter, and pistachio/parmesan crusted trout. Portions were generous and the fish was cooked perfectly, my bronzino had crispy skin and moist flesh. Hats off to them for maintaining the quality of the dining experience in the circumstances.

During the pandemic decided to enjoy a nice outdoor restaurant. First off the staff adhered to the protocols in place for dining. Which is great to see. You can see the staff clean the tables very thoroughly after the table is used.

Virginia was our waitress and she explained the items on the menu as there are a bunch of great options.  She explained the different textures of the fishes once cooked so it made it easier to choose from. She recommended that I get the mix grill option of salmon and swordfish. Which was great cause both are my style of fishes I like to eat.  Virginia was amazing. Her service was impeccable

I would eat here again for sure.

We were there for dinner.  The staff was extremely friendly and the service was fantastic.  But the food was A-mazing!  We started with the raw oysters and the grilled octopus.  The grilled octopus was so tender and delicious.  The oysters were out of this world!!!  The rest of the dinner did not disappoint either.  I had the Chilean sea bass, which is my favorite.  It was light and flaky and seasoned to perfection.  
I would highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys having fresh raw oysters and seafood.

///

One of my favorite places to visit when I'm in town. I get the same thing every time with my family: buffalo calamari, scallops, and creamed spinach. We also always get dessert!

The ambiance is outstanding, the food is so fresh, and the waitstaff is so accommodating! Definitely on the pricier side, but worth every penny!

///

We just walked in after goi g to theater. Food was awesome and service was excellent. Our waitress was so attentive and sincere. Wish I could remember her name.

Delish and on Point!

What a delicious meal, and our server Virginia was on point! I only had to glance and nod and she new what I wanted/needed. It was my Mom's 80th birthday celebration and it was just perfect. From the calamari that was spiced and fried to perfection, the lime shrimp app was awesome, my crab cakes were spectacular, Mom's lobster was sweet and cooked perfectly, the guys both Loved the Tuna and Chilean Seabass too. Even the asparagus was cooked perfectly. They even let me have the birthday cake delivered. I can't rave enough about the place. Yes, it is pricey, but worth every friggin dime!!

I use to work at a restaurant, so let me clue a few folks in on a little secret for most places. Don't go on Mon, Tues or even Wed... the best chef always works Thur - Sun.

GREAT job guys, I will definitely be back!

///

Amazing quality. Service is impeccable. Being a BYOB frees up a couple of dollars to get that 3rd order of oysters. And a big thank you to Virginia!

///

This was the best seafood place I have been to in a while..  chilean Seabass is awesome!!!
Loved the buffalo shrimp too!!
Cindy our server was awesome as well!!

Fantastic food and good atmosphere. One of the best restaurants in the area.

A bit pricey though and way tooooo much of AC! I was freezing there in the mid of hot summer season.

Ivory salmon was just fantastic!!
Great that they put all types of dressings on a side so you have a healthy choices :)

Yes, recommended for dinner with friends, family, and also can work with a date.

///

Awesome rooftop seating on a beautiful night. Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Will be back.

Hands down my favorite restaurant in Princeton. Love how fresh and good quality the seafood is. They make excellent octopus, perfectly cooked each time I've ordered it. The shrimp and pasta entree is very tasty too with a good amount of nicely sized shrimp. They have a rooftop patio and sidewalk seating, which is great in the summer months. Service is always friendly and efficient. BYOB a plus.

///

Amazing! Always has been always will be. Too many meals and celebrations here to count and every single one has been amazing. Freshest fish in the area, amazing oysters. Super service. Absolute gem of a restaurant right here in 08540!

///

Fantastic all way round!! What a delicious meal, so fresh and satisfying. The selection is awesome, the wait staff know their fish:))
Great ambiance, I can't wait to go back again. Thank you Blue Point Grill, we will be back soon.

///

Been here for all different occasions and always meets our expectations and then some. Our go to seafood place.

///

Hands down best restaurant in Princeton. Whenever I am in town for work, this is the place I go. Although it's BYOB, there is a liquor store next door that sells excellent wine. If you are a fish and seafood lover, this is the place to go.

///

A must for any seafood-lover in the NJ area. The star here is the freshness of the fish, which the chef showcases by keeping the preparations simple. The restaurant's BYOB policy is also a nice way to keep the tab down - or let you try even more things from the laundry list of different kinds of seafood that the BPG offers.

///

Best restaurant in town. I have never been disappointed with anything I ordered here. If you do not know what to get, go with the "fresh grill/fresh catch of the day". Always call for a reservation on any day, whether it is a party of 2 or 10. It is always packed.
