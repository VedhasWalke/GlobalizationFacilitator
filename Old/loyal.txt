I've been coming here for years and I have been here only once since CoVID. I can't wait to come back to dine at Salt Creek Grill with my family and office staff alike!!

///

I've been frequenting Salt Creek Grille for many years now, primarily for Happy Hour.  

///

I love coming here for happy hours after work.

///

Salt Creek Grille has passed the test of time, while many businesses have come & gone in the once thriving Princeton Forrestal Village. Been to several happy hour outings here, as the bar area is the right combination of cozy and trendy. 

///

I used to come here for happy hour often. Great wine selection and small bites; service is always spot on.

///

never wrote a review surprisingly.... this place is tucked in Princeton Forrestal Village off of Rt 1 south. You kinda have to navigate around the complex to find your way to Salt Creek. 

///

Every time I have been here, I have always had the best meal. I'm a steak girl and all of their steaks  are always on point and delicious!

///

This is one of my favorite restaurants, I have been here plenty of times mostly because of their cocktails and delicious foods with great ambiance. Thursday is a good time to come for their half price cocktails. I just love this place

///

I loveeee salt creek grill. Their ingredients are always fresh and the service is always great.

///

We go here quite often so I thought it was time to re-review.  Still as good as always.  Staff is good and is food great.  My only complaint is noise level, but that has always been the case and usually doesn't stop us from going.
Keep up the good work!

///

This is probably my favorite spot in town. For the very first time I tried grilled Cesar salad and I liked it. 

///

I have always enjoyed the atmosphere here Friday or Saturday nights. The wine selection is good and the food is excellent. Service is always great. On the nights with live  music it's even better!!

///

I love this place.  Request to sit with Heather, not because I know her personally, but because I've found her to be the best server over the years that I've been a patron!  (she's been there since opening!)

From happy hour, to a quick bite, to lunch, to dinner - anytime I've come in it has been a great experience.

///

Salt Creek grille is our son's favorite resteraunt.  

///

Great restaurant with nice atmosphere and always great service from our waitress Heather she gets our order right each and every time and is very professional and friendly.

///

Just amazing. Get steak and frites and you will never go wrong. Wine is also top notch. We make trips to this town just for this place.

///

We've been going to Salt Creek Grille for a few years now, and have consistently requested Heather! She always remembers what we like and is a pleasure to interact with during our dining experience.

///

The food is always fantastic, and we typically share the grilled Caesar salad and soufflé for dessert. We try to order different things for our entrées, and Salt Creek Grille never disappoints!

///

They have live music from time to time and it can get loud.  Service has always been very good.

///

One of the Gem in the town. This is my fave place for hanging out

///

Always worth going there! The ribs and chicken are always a go to

///

Amazing food and service and never walked out disappointed -- whether it's the salmon or specialty plate, it's obvious care and attention goes into every aspect of dining here.

///

Seared ahi tuna salad is a solid staple here. I've had it a dozen times and it's always been reliably tasty.

///

This is my favorite place to eat. I only eat steak from here because they cook it EXACTLY how i like it (very well done, no pink) every single time! The waitresses are nice and the restaurant has a nice vibe.

///

 I like the place a lot and wished it were in my area.  The food is well prepared and very flavorful.  I especially like the bar area and the live music.  

///

I always know I can get a good meal here. 

///

The menu changes each night and is not extensive.  However I can always find something I like!  The bar menu is huge and the drinks are always good.

///

This is the go-to place for my husband and I for a "small celebration" dinner. The servers are all phenomenal - we've always had friendly, prompt, helpful service. 

///

I'm a frequent flyer at Salt creek. Like literally come all the time. Even have a rewards card to prove it. 

///

Love that they redid the menu it was FINALLY time for a change. They have had the same menu forever so it was quite refreshing to see new items. Not crazy about the revamped happy hour menu though. Used to always get the ahi tuna stack and when I saw ahi Tuna on the new menu, I ordered it, assuming it was the same dish as the previous menu.

///

My favorite  post movie place to go. Typically eat in the bar where the food and service is just as good as in main restaurant rooms. 

///

I love this place!  the staff is always welcoming and remembers you - not just what you eat or drink, but your name and usually something personal.

///

This is a great place for happy hour around the Princeton area with generous portions and discounted drinks. My friends come here often, so they knew what to get right away.

///

 I've been to Salt Creek a lot, and have never once had an issue with service.

///

One of our favorite restaurants my husband and I go all the time the ambience is relaxing and food is delicious and our server Heather is so professional that we ask to be seated in her section each time.

///

I've been here several times and consistently good chow, especially their beef. Wife likes it too and we have had great mixed drinks and excellent service every time!

///

We've eaten here many times and never had a bad meal. 

///

Have been to this location so many times! Food and drinks are always delicious and innovative.

///

Always have great experiences here and will continue to frequent this restaurant!

The food here is always amazing and our server, Heather, made it even better! Our favorite menu item is the Butter Cake, recommended to us by Heather!

Scott is such a nice server, he always remembers us and is very welcoming
Scott is the best! He always remembers us and we always ask for him!
