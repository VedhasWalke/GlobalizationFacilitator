Visit Jhopri restaurant, where we serve not just a cuisine, but an experience that goes beyond mere satisfaction of appetite to the realm of sensuality: an evocative presentation of aromas, flavors and textures that pays tribute to an appreciation of the finer things in life to become A Grand Cuisine. Our menu offers a welcome change from the ordinary that is not only pleasing to the palate, but a healthful alternative as well, with the use of vegetables and leaner meats. Jhopri serves both vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisine for Eat-in and Take-out
