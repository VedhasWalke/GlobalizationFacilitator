I am a regular here, and I always enjoy my experience. Over living in Plainsboro for several years, I have enjoyed Crown of India through sit-in dining, the lunch buffet, and take out. All have been excellent experiences.
Some other reviewers seem very knowlegeable about Indian food. I do not  have as much experience with Indian, so my tastes may not be so discerning. But I have eaten at many other places and very much preferred the food at Crown of India.
