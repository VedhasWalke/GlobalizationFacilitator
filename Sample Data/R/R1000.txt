Palace of Asia started my annual (2 years running now) exploration of Indian joints in the West Windsor/Plainsboro area.  This occurs once a year when I'm home at my parents for Thanksgiving and looking for food with high school friends Thanksgiving day.  You'd never know it was here driving by.  It's located deep in a strip mall/shopping center and we discovered it on a whim driving around in search of lunch.
Palace of Asia was the first Indian restaurant and it was a great start.  The food was delicious!  We didn't stop for the buffet, it did look good, but instead ordered a bunch of dishes as takeout.  Small mistake on Thanksgiving day, since we ended up with way too much food and pigged out during lunch, impacting my ability to eat Thanksgiving dinner.  This is probably a testament to how good the food is though.  If I spoiled my Thanksgiving dinner for it.  Note that the prices are a bit high for Indian food, but worth it in my mind.
