We have always loved this place and appreciated the management.  We catered 2 weddings through this restaurant and multiple private parties.  Today just totally turned that ALL around.  
We ordered 45 samosas for $25 as quoted on the phone.  When we got there and they charged us $45 we knew it was wrong.  So now they are coming to my house to collect the extra 15 samosas they gave me and going to give me my money back.  
So rather than providing a good customer service experience, they are now willing to risk food contamination and drive someone all the way to my house to collect samosas.  
They could have easily fixed the charge over the phone and said, just keep the extra samosas.  
you just lost not 1 ...but a full extended family of patrons.
