Came here for the lunch buffet. It had a good vegetarian selection about five dishes and three meat selections. They did not have samosas which was odd for an Indian lunch buffet. They did however have three types of dessert and Papa dam. I had a great time and enjoyed my food. The best thung about this place is the ambiance. It is just beautiful. Staff was friendly and there was parking outside.
