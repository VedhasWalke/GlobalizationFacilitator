This place surely serves great Indian food in comparison to the other Indian restaurants in the area . But that is not all- the decor is great, the place is massive - all in all gives a real grand feeling when you walk in. They have the big dining room open for all to see and it does look Royal. The good part is the food is good which will always be the number 1 priority for people- you will not go 'waoooza' but then there is really nothing to complain.
The standout dish in the buffet was the 'lamb korma' - Kashmiri style nice and hot which went so well with the rice . They have a decent food Spread- catering to vegetarians and meat eaters.
The buffet is decently priced at $12. Only if the indian restaurants add masala tea to the buffet - it would just be awesome.
Make sure you try the place and you won't be disappointed.
