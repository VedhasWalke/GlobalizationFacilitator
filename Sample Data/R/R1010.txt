I came last night with my roommate cause we had a craving for Indian food. The waiter was amazing! We were about to order the "Dinner for Two" course and he warned us it was a lotttt of food. Thank god he did because we were stuffed with what we ordered. We got an appetizer of the jalapeno bites. They are SUPER spicy. And I love spicy, so take that as a warning from me. The tikki masala and chicken tandoori were perfect! I loved how perfect the portions were for 2 people and the rice was perfectly cooked. The garlic naan was very fresh as well. I will definitely be returning and hopefully for the lunch buffet!
