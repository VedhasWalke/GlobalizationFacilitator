Been here a few times for their lunch buffet and the spread is nothing great. They have a cuple of items for each variety though. They don't serve naan or anything else at the table.
But - have alcohol license and they clear the plates away quickly. So decent service for a buffet place. Nothing better in the area, so we visit it often
