I have been here twice now. Once during lunch which was a buffet and it was really nice! The food is good not great but enjoyable the place is really nice and big yet cozy! The dessert here is not that good and for dinner we had chicken, panner and samosa it was okay. My fiancé said the chicken was that great! But the rest was fine.
