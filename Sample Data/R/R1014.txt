hands down the best buffet I've ever been to!  found out 2 years ago I LOVE Indian food.  going for a regular meal can be pricey & spicy.  We always opt for the buffet because its not mouth on fire spicy & the options are a plenty!  my co-workers and I go at least 1x a month we enjoy it so much!  servers and polite & pleasant.  its always clean & the décor is great.
