Actually 4 1/2 stars and deservedly so, this big operation Indian restaurant looks like it would be very comfortable in Manhattan.  Very nice medium size bar to enjoy a libation before your meal and to relax.  The servers just right, there when you need them but not in you face when you don't.  The word palace, in their name, aptly describes the impression one has walking in the door.
Now for the best part, the food is delicious and the selection is huge, everything including beef dishes on the menu, which is rare for an Indian restaurant.  Everything spiced wonderfully and containing the right amount of heat.  Although a bit of a haul from the Jersey shore - well worth the trip.  We will return...
