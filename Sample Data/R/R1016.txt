I've been eating at Palace of Asia practically since my family moved to NJ.  I can remember so many delicious Indian meals there, even dating back to when it was located where Hooters now is at Mercer Mall.  The decor has always been a bit too elegant for its strip mall surroundings but that is far from a complaint.  The service is consistently professional and kind, and I can think of a few instances when our server has been especially attentive over the years.  The food, however, always has been and continues to be simply terrific.  
In recent years, my family has adopted the tradition of going to Palace of Asia for the Saturday lunch buffet when I come to the area.  We have such varied tastes in food and my mom and sister have dietary restrictions, but the impressive spread of appetizers, entrees, breads and desserts allow us all to have a sumptuous lunch.  
Of the foods I've had there, I especially recommend the tandoori chicken which has a great almost-smokey flavor, the particularly flavorful biriyani, the pakoras and anything with their paneer cheese.  I've never had anything less than a positive experience there though overall.
In an area with a large Indian population and thus many Indian restaurants (including the three Indian places on or near Nassau Street in downtown Princeton), Palace of Asia is the true stand-out.  I urge you to give it a try whether for a buffet lunch, a dinner with family and friends or even a private party--you will not be disappointed.
