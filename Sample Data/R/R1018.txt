One of the worst Indian restaurant and banquet place I have ever been to. I ate their couple of times. Every time I ate there the food was disgusting. I went there for New Year's eve party and I wasted $150 the place the food the service it with just pathetic I will never go back there again. And I recommend other people not to go there and waste your money.
