Palace of Asia is the second best Indian restaurant in Mercer County.
Not a small part of this is due to the ambiance--though their take out process is also pretty great. You walk into Palace and immediately feel like you are not in a random NJ suburb. It's a great, immersive experience.
The food is pretty great all around. The Navratan Korma is deep and rich with a ton of different veggies. I wish instead of a Palak they did a Saag Paneer, but it's still pretty solid stuff. Three samosas is a nice touch instead of the usual two.
My only major issue is the price. Veggie dishes at $15+ seems a bit insane. All their veggie dishes should be two to three dollars cheaper. But, I guess you also get the ambiance and all that other good stuff included as well.
