Absolutely love Palace of Asia! Come for the Lunch Buffet. They have an assortment of meat and vegetarian dishes. I can't remember half the of the dishes but the vegetable balls in coconut sauce and the vegetable fritters were flavorful.
Wait staff is super attentive and quick to answer any questions!
