This establishment gets a zero for horrible customer service. Tonight my husband picked up an online order. He was handed a large paper bag and told "goodnight." When he got home, there was a dish missing. When I called to point it out to them they both refused to deliver the dish (we live very close by) OR simply refund us the cost of the dish.  The man on the phone seriously said, "we all make mistakes." Really?!  We will not be ordering from them again. Order at your own risk. They may or may not give you your complete order.
