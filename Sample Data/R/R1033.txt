This used to be a good - not outstanding, but good - Indian restaurant.  
Unfortunately, the quality of the food and of the service have been declining rapidly.  
To further impact what has now become a standard of below average food and service, the establishment has apparently attempted to compensate a loss of patrons by implementing a very aggressive tip policy.  While many restaurants often appropriately add a house tip for parties of 8 or so (to ensure that the waitperson is fairly compensated), it is never added to the bill of four or less patrons.  So we were disappointed to see a 'new policy' tip of 18% arbitrarily added on to our bill - in this case for exceptionally poor service:  one of the diners had to wait until the other three had practically finished eating before receiving their main dish, and another entrée had to be requested three times before finally being brought out.
The food? Average at best.  It has been slipping almost as fast as the service.  Disappointing, especially for what used to be a better than average Indian establishment.
It seems Palace of Asia has become the caboose of Indian restaurants in the Princeton / Lawrenceville area.
