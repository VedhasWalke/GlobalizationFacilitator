My family and I love coming here for the lunch buffet!  The service is always tentative and the waiters are very friendly. The food is out on the buffet table and is always refreshed, as more food is added usually every 15-20 minutes.  It is so fresh and there are constantly people lining up for food because it is so busy during the lunch hours.  We have never been disappointed by any of the food here and we always fill up on our favorites!  Basmati rice and naan are always available to soak up all the saucy goodness of the dishes.  My favorites are the cashmere chicken and chicken tandoori, but I really enjoy it all.  My family prefers the lamb or one of the several vegetarian options available here.  After filling up on the rich food there is always a dessert option.  I enjoy the Gulab Jamun, which is little dough balls with a sugar syrup, and the Indian rice pudding.  It is a beautiful restaurant with the best Indian food I've ever had; a must for people who enjoy this type of cuisine!
