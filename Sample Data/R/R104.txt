We were craving Myilai Masala, but it is a little bit of a trip, so we decided to go here, as it is right around the corner. We went for dinner and were the only people in the whole place. It felt awkward as it was only us and it was totally silent, there was no music playing. The food was pretty good. It's a good place to go when we don't feel like taking the trip to our favorite Indian restaurant.
