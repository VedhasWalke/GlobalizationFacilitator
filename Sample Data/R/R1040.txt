A classic case of "don't judge a book by its cover." From the outside this place looks like a run-of-the-mill restaurant in a run down strip mall. On the inside though, the restaurant is very nicely decorated-chandeliers, domed ceilings.  
We went here for the lunch buffet. Like most Indian buffets, it's a pretty good deal with a decent selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  Everything was fresh.  The Paneer Masala was sweeter than most Indian food I've had.  The Tandoori chicken was a little bland.  The Mango D'fengo was way too sweet.  For Indian food, this ranks among the best I've ever had.
The only thing that annoyed me was that because our group was 16 they added on tip. I know this is standard practice but for a lunch buffet?! 18% gratuity seems steep for bringing us water....and nothing else.
