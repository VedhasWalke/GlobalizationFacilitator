If you build it they will come.  I've known the owner, (N) for over 3 decades and when he cooks it - everyone comes.  When first started, his one little restaurant was nestled in this tiny back corner of a huge, totally empty supermarket.  When you entered the hollow, echoing space and hiked the dimly-lit path to what seemed like hastily constructed thin walls (following the aroma of his spices) it filled the entire open space and led you right up to his his "restaurant".  Opening the thin door brought you in full view of not only a few sparse tables but the entire kitchen as well.  But for the high ceiling of the supermarket - there was no roof.  
Not a native of India - but having volunteered a few years at Mother Teresa's mission - I was very familiar with the standard food of that region, so when I took the first bite of his food I all but melted: it was incredible - I remember using the word "divine"!
We used to joke that he must have invited all the local bankers to a banquet and that their fighting voices as to who would get to be the one to loan him the money for his future endeavors - filled the entire supermarket!  
But to have witnessed the growth from these humble beginnings to what has been accomplished, well, suffice to say I've not needed to eat my Indian cuisine anywhere else these 30 years later.  And really, nothing much has changed except that you now enter into a huge, well-decorated space thru a door in an unassuming strip mall!  
The food is the same quality as it can't be improved upon and I'm never reticent to introduce my friends and acquaintances to his venue as no one ever leaves disappointed.  We, both vegetarian and gluten-free doctors, are so grateful for his fine palate, attention to detail and his expertise and we will continue to dine here, at "PALOFA" (as we now call it) for as long as I live.
