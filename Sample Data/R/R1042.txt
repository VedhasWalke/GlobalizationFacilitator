Stop by for lunch buffet with 3 other friends. Big place with elegance decor so we all walk in with high hopes. Plenty of appetizing selections, we stuffed ourselves and left happy. That being said, I would like to offer a few suggestions. First the seatings, I get it..more tables means more business but it can get a little bit claustrophobic and too noisy when it's crowded. Second, I'm Indian myself and I accept  my Indian food to be strong in flavor and spicy. Perhaps they've Americanized it?
