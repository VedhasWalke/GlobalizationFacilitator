Nice decor and ambience, friendly staff, quick service, and tasty food. We ordered the Tamaatar Aloo soup, Chicken Vindaloo, Vegetable Makhani, and the Bread Basket. The Chicken Vindaloo was mildly spicy and well cooked with a reasonable portion for 2 to 3 people. The Tamaatar Aloo soup was Ok in taste and quantity, while the sauce in the Vegetable Makhani had a strong buttery flavor...the Bread Basket had Roti, Naan, Garlic Naan, and Puri (fried bread) enough for a group of 2 or 3 people...very good food although I found it a little $expensive$ compared to similar subcontinental joints in the area....will definitely try the lunch buffet some day...
