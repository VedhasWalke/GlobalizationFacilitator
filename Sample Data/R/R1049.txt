I'm sorry but I can't agree with the other reviews. I've just sampled probably the worst takeout ever. The chicken tikka masala was inedible, the sauce was OK but the chicken was square tasteless lumps with a strange flavor. Tried calling the restaurant to let them know I was disappointed and I was cut off.  I've been to plenty of Indian restaurants across the globe, so I have a good opinion. The takeout cost me $60 for two people, it ended up in the trash.
Now I understand why there was no one in the restaurant.
