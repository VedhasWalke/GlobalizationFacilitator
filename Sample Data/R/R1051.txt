This place has a wonderful ambiance and I would like to rate it as 5 in hygiene and aesthetics, but the food lacks a good taste. We had ordered for paneer bhurji, chicken vindaloo and dal makhni and all three of them tasted average. Chicken vindaloo was nothing like what I had expected it to be. The gravy was tomato based and tasted too tangy rather than spicy. Well, given the price that this place charges and the kind of ambiance it offers, people might expect a lot..but the food is a major let down
