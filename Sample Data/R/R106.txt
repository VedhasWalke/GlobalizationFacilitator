Just ordered food from here and it was horrendous.  Ordered Kadai Paneer, vegetable samosa and egg biryani and simple paratha.  Basically everything had at least 2 pounds of sautéed onions in them.  There were so many onions in the Kadai paneer that once I took them all out there were less than 1/4 of the paneer and masala.  The taste was nothing but that of onions.  The biryani was poorly made and had a foul odor from it like it was an old batch with the eggs mixed in to the rice instead of whole eggs sliced that you usually see with egg biryani.  Again, the biryani  had at least a lb. or two of sautéed onions.  The paratha tasted like microwaved roti.  Please do not eat here and think this is how awful Indian food tastes.
