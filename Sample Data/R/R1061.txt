All dishes are 2-3 $ more expensive in DoorDash . It's a little pricey for the quantity .. we liked the non veg andhra style dishes here . Veg is ok . Biryani was good . Nice and sumptuous. I liked chilly paneer and kids loved it too.
Their best dish was andhra style  65. Do try it . If you are close by , order and pick up. Don't do doordash. It's quite expensive with door dash.
Overall good food.. 4/5
