Having read the reviews decided to try the lunch thali.
The guy said it was buffet for lunch
Should have left the restaurant
Simple words food was a disaster
Appetizers veggies were soaked in oil and the chicken tangdi smelt and the inside was pink which means undercooked and a open invitation for food poisoning
Biryani' was super duper hot should be named volcanic Biryani sure to clear your sinuses
Coming to the dessert the so called shahi tukda looked like vomit
Gulab jamun tray was empty and on asking the jamuns looked ice cold out of a can
A lesson think twice before going in
