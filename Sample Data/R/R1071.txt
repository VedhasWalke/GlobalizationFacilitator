I have been going to this place from the day it opened in North Brunswick in NJ. I have visited all the branches as well - In Green St., In Princeton, In Lexington Ave and in North Brunswick. I just had take-out today and the quality of the food has remained consistent. The cuisines that I order have been always cooked to perfection from day one until today. I have personally received good attention and hospitality from who ever servers me (Dine-In  or Take-out) on every single occasion. And btw, I have lost count how many times I have been there. I go there on a weekly basis though. Thanks Anjappar for bringing us Chettinad Food to us to NJ - brings back lot of memories to Tamilians like me who grew up eating Chettinad food. Wishing you all the very best.
