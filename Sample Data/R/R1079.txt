An authentic chettinad experience right here in the northeast. We were a party of two from NY and MA and we stopped here specifically for this subset of Indian cuisine and it was a great food experience. Don't expect too much on the service end. The food came out very quickly. I was impressed with that. The food is great. On the spicy end of things. Great experience. They should open up more places in the tri state.
