Been coming here with my family for a couple years. If you want authentic South Indian cuisine then you must try this restaurant. If you enjoy spicy food you'll be very satisfied with their flavors. Particularly their non - vegetarian options are my favorites but the vegetarian food is also very good from what my friends have said.
