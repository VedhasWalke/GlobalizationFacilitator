Ordered these 3 from Anjappar menu for pickup
Mutton uncooked tasted like soaked in salt
Prawns masala was like liquid and watery kuzhambu
Kothu parota had very stale chicken pieces
These 2  are for Meals , veg meals was authentic-sambar rasam kootu payasam
If u don't have something on the menu pls say them don't serve us a unhealthy food we prefer brands for same and even quality wherever we eat .
