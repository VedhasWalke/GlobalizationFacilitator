I recently had a horrendous experience with a take out order. I ordered egg biryani and what I got was that, with pieces of chicken in it. I am a vegetarian who occasionally likes to eat eggs and when I ordered the dish I wasn't expecting to see meat. My guess, they recycled chicken biryani, added a couple of eggs to it and were selling it as a separate dish. How convenient!!
The worst part? the manager Mr. Kannan had the gall to tell me I should be looking at the menu better while ordering and that, egg biryani was listed as a non-vegetarian item and is made with CHICKEN BROTH!!! What??? He also went ahead and gave me a piece of advice that vegetarians shouldn't eat egg to start with. WHAT again??
their menu lists egg biryani in the biryani section right under the vegetable biryani which can easily mislead people and it absolutely does not have chicken broth in the ingredients list. Such lies its unbelievable!!!
The management and the cleanliness of the Princeton and North Brunswick locations is terrible and they do not know how to treat their customers. This is not my first experience but I finally found some time to write a review.
The restaurant in Princeton markets itself as upscale but they are far from it. I would never go back.
