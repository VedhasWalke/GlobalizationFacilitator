I read a lot of positive and negative review for this place and I was skeptical to try this out. Nevertheless I gave it a shot on Sat night. I was not expecting much but hey, doesn't harm in trying out.
Service was average to good. Not excellent because it was a small place and too many people.
Ordered Nandu Rasam ( Crab Soup). it was delicious and amazing. Was bit spicy but that's fine. loved it
Chicken 65 was ok.
Stuffed Mutton Keema Parotha( Minced goat meat stuffed in flatbread) was good. Comes with Raita and gravy.
Would like to try this place next time.
