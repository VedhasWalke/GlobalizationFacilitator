Okay the ambience is very average and it is topped with very poor service. You would still wait thinking cmon what matters is food, right?
Wrong! After the rasam and buttermilk, everything is a downfall. The gravy with appam, prawns 65, mutton curry all are very average. The fish signature curry is extra tangy and not in a good way.
Total opposite of its branch in NY @ Lexington. Avoid.
