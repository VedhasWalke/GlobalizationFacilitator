I was looking for a - "0" but Yelp doesn't have one !
The last couple of years have been downhill for this chain. They just want to expand and go ring the register. No service / Poor quality of food and "blah" ambience.
The last time I went to the restaurant the service was atrocious and the food was like - "eat it or leave it - because we ARE Anjappar" !
Well guess what ? Thanks to Yelp we can vent !
I ordered takeout today hoping ( I'm a sucker for punishment) the food would be better !!
1. Veg Biryani - hardly any vegetables in there. Carrots are decorative items here.
2. Fish fry - the fish was stale and smelly that my maid wouldn't touch it.
3. Chicken lollipop - what used to be a "signature dish" - is now double fried and double browned !
The chicken was buried so deep in the rice flour so deeply fried that it took me a while to get to the meat. It was definitely double fried as the oil was dark and it was stale.
Sorry was this from yesterday's leftover ? WTF?
NEVER NEVER EVER GOING / TAKING OUT from this chain again ! I once l used to frequent the original in Chennai growing up.
This is a huge disappointment and the management BETTER  take notice of its wayward path or it will be curtains very soon.
