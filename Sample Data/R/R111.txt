This used to be a good place for indian food but it has declined tremendously in quality, taste and service. The staff is rude and not friendly at all. The service is pathetic. There was no one to seat us at the counter for 5 mins. Even after the staff came in and saw us, did not bother walking to us and one other guest to seat. The food is very tasteless. We usually go in here for the Buffett. Indian food is supposed to be very flavorful and have a nice blend of spices. The food here is just the opposite. The most disappointing part of the visit was a sharp plastic piece in the gajar ka halwa. I know I'm not coming bad here.
