My rating is purely based on one and only one item that I frequently get from this place
* PAROTA AND CHICKEN CURRY COMBO
The above dish at this place is a must have, its a bomb, so good I come back almost every other week to get the above as a take out.
Apart from the above the place has issues
* a La Cart'e is not their strong suit.
* You need to wait up a long time for your order to be ready.
* Most of the stuff on their menu do not justify the taste for the price they charge, their crab special was a big flop with all my friends I had taken out for dinner here one time.
