Best South Indian chettinad food in USA. Period!
Chicken Lollypop, Mutton Sukka varuval, Parota, Keema Parota, Chicken Chettinad are  excellent choices!
Have dined here many times (1 hour from my house).. Worth the trip everytime!
Costly.. yes.. but worth it!
Edison (when they had the branch there) and NYC (service is really bad)!!  No complaints about North Brunswick though. it is the place to be!
