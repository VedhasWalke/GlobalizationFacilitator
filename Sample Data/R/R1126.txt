Had been to the one at Lexington...which was much better in service...the tandoori pomfret was good...and the mango lassi was perfectly sweet....but the egg kottu paratha was really not up to the mark...was disappointed with that....main course also had mutton masala which was again really yummy...next time would try the Thai
