So this place has steadily and predictably gone terribly downhill over the past few years. Initially the food was delicious but the service was always suspect. Now the food is appalling and the service is non-existent. We got up several times during Sunday lunch to get our own napkins and utensils. Our food was staggered and so the last mutton dish arrived after all were well past lunch. Plus no one seemed to have any idea of what was going on.
In the past, we justified patronage of this place because we liked the food. Now we can safely say that there is really no reason at all to eat here... Food is disastrous and service is atrocious.
