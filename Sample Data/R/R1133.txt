I went here twice to get Chicken Lollipop and guess what...Both times the Chicken was covered in UNDERCOOKED batter, all mushy. Not sure if they understand how to COOK Chicken (which I think is pretty easy). There was no rush, the dinning hall was almost empty so the chef had all the time in the world to prepare my dish. I would recommend people to go to Shoprite (right across the street), buy chicken and fry it!!!!
