Most famous dish here is CRAB MASALA. Tried but dint feel great. Lot of masala dominates the taste. Some may like it. But then its not my type.
I tried Biryani and Mutton curry too. Taste is is not like authentic Hyderabadi style. Typical tamil style cooking with lot of Pepper, which dominates the taste in the dishes...
