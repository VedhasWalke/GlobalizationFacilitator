Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The service was excellent, the interior atmosphere was very pleasant. The food was fresh, warm, and really taste with the perfect level of spice (I ordered plain dosa and gobhi manchurian). This is a place I would definitely recommend and will 100% go back.
