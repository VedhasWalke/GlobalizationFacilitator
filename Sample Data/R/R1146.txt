If it was possible, I'd give a quarter of a star.
The food is the most awful I've ever disgraced my palette with.
First ,We ordered pepper chicken for appetiser, the chicken was stale , maybe a day old.
Next was mutton curry which had total if 4 pieces of bones with ONLY fatty bits on it- NO MEAT whatsoever.
Next was butter chicken masala, again with miniscule 5 pieces of chicken.
The food was served before the plates were handed out !!
They forgot about our crab masala altogether!
So after waiting for 20 minutes, the big plate of curry arrived with crab legs floating in it, with shell!!
Needless to say , we had to ASK for pincers to crack open the shells.
The process of trying to get meat out of the curry soaked she'll was do messy, that we gave up eating entirely.
How can somebody screw up plain white rice !!??
Well apparently anjappar Chettinad is he is in that too .
Cold, stale rice reeking of coconut oil, which is ok, if it didn't leave an after taste in the mouth
I'll NEVER EVER ho eat there and absolutely forbid my friends to go there as well.
