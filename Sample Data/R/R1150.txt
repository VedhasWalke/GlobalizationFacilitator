Came here for dinner on a monday and there were a few other families, and only one waiter, but service was still quick and attentive. Food was quite good. The dishes that stood out: lamb curry(but had too many potatoes and not enough lamb), scrambled parotta, lollipop chicken appetizer. Dishes that didn't work quite so well: chicken 65 appetizer was too greasy/soft like it hadn't been fried properly, and chili chicken with gravy tasted like a hot chemical mess. The paapadums were just the right amount of crispy. This is nitpicky but I didn't like that the rice was plain and wasn't flavored with peas or cumin or anything else, and I also wish that they offered parotta as one of the bread options. Also the music from the audio  is too loud. Finally, this place is a little bit on the expensive side for an Indian restaurant in brusnwick area
