The best indian food ever!! Hands down my favourite restaurant. It was my birthday and we tried chef special Nattu kodi pulusu with paratha and Nattu kodi biryani,pepper chicken dry,mutton egg masala,couple of soups and Fish Biryani. Every dish tasted excellent and the nattu kodi pulusu was out of the world experience.
It was the best and spiciest food I had ( I am from Andhra and i do eat very spicy food) .We thanked the Chef and the owner profusely for such incredible tasting dishes. Every item on their menu tasted equally good and it is the best bang for your buck.  Try it once and you will go back multiple times. Anjappar you are the best.
