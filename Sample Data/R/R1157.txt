Anjappar is my two decade old favorite since my college days in Coimbatore. However the food quality and value has disappointingly fallen to abysmal levels. The lime juice reminded me of my mother's favorite expression( "tastes like drainage water") and they charge an unbelievable $4 for the non-sense. It's not the old Anjappar! i would never come back to this Anjappar again. I recommend their competition in Edison ( Karaikudi).
