Anjappar is a non-vegetarian chain restaurant from South India. Their food is quite different from the North Indian food which is served in most Indian restaurants. When I go to Anjappar, I always order Chicken 65, Chicken Lollypop, Mutton Bone Soup, and South Indian/Madras Coffee. I also like their biryanis, fish fry, and mutton sukka masala (take it to go, tastes better the next day). Their weekdays lunch buffet is an excellent value for those who want to get a little taste of their menu.  It can be very crowded during the weekends, but they recently expanded the restaurant to accomodate more diners. Good service, friendly host. BYOB.
The only downside for me is the desserts (and also the fact that it's 40 miles away from where I live) but it does not take any star away from this place. Be sure to check out the specials listed on the board by the cashier for some interesting items that are not on the menu like appam, paniyarram etc. If you are new to South Indian food, you might also want to try the staples e.g. Dosas, Idlis. I don't order these here because I live in JC and we have Sri Ganesh Dosa House :P
Please note that they  have a couple of hours between lunch and dinner when they closed down the restaurant. I think it's between 3:30 and 5:30 but you might want to confirm.
