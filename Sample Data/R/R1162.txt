After reading reviews from fellow Yelpers about this place I was pretty reluctant to dine in at this place. It was rather a pleasant surprise. Food was good and the service was excellent. Everyone was very polite and the food tasted great. I happened to mention to the server that it was my husband's birthday and without our prior knowledge all the servers brought a complimentary dessert with a candle specially prepared for us at the end of our meal. It was such a sweet gesture. Will definitely recommend.
