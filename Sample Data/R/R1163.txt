A bunch of us actually rented a car, drove all the way down to this little town JUST TO EAT AT ANJAPPARs.
This is authentic stuff people. not for amateurs....the food is spicey as all hell and it is incredible. I was pretty much euphoric from the spice overload and very very full (but the food is not unhealthy so you feel un-full an hour or so later).
Definitely go for the "meals" i.e. the plate with all the awesomeness of several vegetables, one meat staple, yoghurt and dessert. It's a plateful of heaven. Do not miss the chicken 65...(my mouth is watering as i write this), nor the fried fish. And Wash it all down with cool, spiced buttermilk...mmmm mmmmm!
This is awesome true-to-its-roots chettinaad food...and is definitely worth the money (even after accounting for gas and car rental !!!) what I wouldn't give for this resto to be in manhattan. I would happily pay three times what I paid.
