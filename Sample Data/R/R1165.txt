We walked in and we were ignored for about 7 minutes. The host was in a far corner of the restaurant having a private convo on the phone. Really? But that I can handle. Service was really good otherwise.
Once we were seated. I had the waiter order for me and I wasn't dissapointed. The food was great.
However, there were bits of food and stuff stuck to the booths and the walls around our table. That is gross. Clean that up. It made me feel a little uncomfortable. If that is what the front of the restaurant looks like, I can't imagine how the kitchen looks.
I wouldn't eat here again just because there are so many other Indian restaurants in the area that are better maintained.
