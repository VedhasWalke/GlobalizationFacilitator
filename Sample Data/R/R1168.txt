Anjappar is a traditional south indian chettinad restaurant. Most of their dishes have their signature flavor and so can hardly be compared to other indian restaurants. Some of their exquisite items include - Chciken/Goat Biriyani,Chicken 65, Chicken Lollipop, Goat Sukka, Crab masala, Kuli Paniyaram to name a few. Service is okay, but their food is very good.
