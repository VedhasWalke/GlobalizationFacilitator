I was with a group of 7 and we ordered Chicken Lollypop, Fish 65, Chicken kothu porotta, Mutton biriyani, porotta and Mango Lassi.
Good - Fish 65, Chicken kothu porotta and Mango Lassi
Average - Chicken Lollypop
Bad - Mutton biriyani, Porotta (biriyani was bland and porotta was uncooked)
Overall service was not good. No one gave us plates for some time even after food arrived. When we mentioned that porotta is uncooked to a restaurant personnel, we got a cold shoulder and the person said that we should tell that to the manager and not to her (She was the one who greets guests and seated us.)
This restaurant doesn't to do any justice to Anjappar's brand name. I am not going there again!
