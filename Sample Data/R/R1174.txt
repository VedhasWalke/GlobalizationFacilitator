Its a long trek from the city with need for a rental car and some friends for company. With no regrets, it was totally worth it. I don't have a reference point for Chettinad food but just by virtue of being Indian, I can say with confidence that this is "Real" Indian food, not fusionized to be accepted in foreign land.
The order was more than our stomachs could accommodate - biryani, chicken, lamb, veggies, rasam, parotha and what not. Each stood true to its description with tangy flavors entering your nostrils not-so-gently. Now we Indians are supposed to be pros at handling spicy food, but Anjappar will put your tolerance level to test. Yes, my tongue was on fire at some point but I continued eating in gastronomical delight.  
The service is fast food in South Indian style - no frills, ask for what you want and you will get it, if its within the means.
Anjappar, good job and 4 lucky stars.
