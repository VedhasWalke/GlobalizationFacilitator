I'd personally give it a 3.5, but I'll do 4 stars, I suppose, because I know how happy this place makes my dad.
I used to love their Kothu Paratha. I noticed a year ago that it just wasn't as good anymore :(
The rest of their items make me pretty happy. Definitely try their egg utthapam!
Dine-in has never been a problem, the food and service was always great. But my family usually does take-out. Not sure that my dad cares too much about their flawed take-out service because he LOVES Anjappar's food that much, but I was pretty annoyed the one time I went to pick up dinner instead.
I was told to come in at a particular time to pick up a box of KP and a tray of Biriyani, but when I got there, it turned out that the order for KP hadn't even gone in (which they tried to hide from me). I ended up waiting 30 extra minutes. The worst part is, there is no waiting area at Anjappar, I was awkwardly standing around for a bit, which was uncomfortable as the restaurant was so crowded. I ended up just taking a empty table for four while I waited.
This place has so much potential! Just please try to improve your customer service!
