This place is simply awesome. note, i didn't dine in, i carried out.. quite possibly the best tasting Indian food around. Their parotta is awesome, quite frankly the best in america. Chicken, crab curry will not disappoint. although, they are more on the spicier side, its a wonderful treat. I cant wait till i go back their again.
