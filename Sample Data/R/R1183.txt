Wish there was an option to give 0 Star!! Such outrageous service. I can't comment on the food since our order never showed up. We went to this place on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded. We sat on a table and someone swings by dropping a Mutton Dish. Remember, we weren't even given a glass of water and of course we didn't order this. We got a nasty attitude from the server when we said this is not something we ordered. We were ready to walk out but we didn't. Eventually, we got to place our order and our food never showed up for 20 minutes. Waiter comes to our table and goes " Are you waiting for something, haven't you gotten you food" We said "NOOO" and guess why. HE NEVER ENTERED THE ORDER IN THE SYSTEM!!!! We asked him to cancel the order and told him that we want to leave.  We didn't even get a single apology. UNBELIEVABLE!!! I have had bad experiences with places like Olive Garden, PF Chang's too but they always make up by saying that that the dessert is on the house or come up with something.
