The lollipop chicken is the worst.  The food is overpriced with small proportions.  No wonder the restaurant was empty on a Saturday Night.  Prices are reflective of a finer restaurant.  No accompaniments or even Chutneys are served.with any food including appetizers.  Save your money and go somewhere where they back up their prices with quality or quantity  Unfortunately, the owner was there but she could not care less.
