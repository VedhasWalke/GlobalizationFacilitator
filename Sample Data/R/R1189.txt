I had wanted to try Anjappar for a long time--I am a big fan of Chettinad food, but there aren't any in the DC area (that I know of).
I ordered the chicken thali, which came with dahl, chettinad chicken curry, rasam, sambar, a vegetable dish, yogurt, rice, and achar.
All of the food was excellent. No dish was too oily or salty, and I could taste the fresh spices, especially in the chicken curry.
I hope that they open a branch in the DC area!
