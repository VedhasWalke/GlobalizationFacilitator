The only reason why this place gets a 4 star opposed to a 5 is the tremendously long wait to get food and any service for that manner. Nice ambiance, pleasant staff, and delicious food. Never these, this place gets extremely crowded on the weekends after 6 so either get there in advance or make reservations. Very clean restaurant within the seating area. Ordered the pad Thai (delicious and flavorful) also plentiful in serving size. Some of my friends had the pineapple fried rice and mango chicken...all of which were good since I had the opportunity to sample everything. I'd come back here again but would make reservations (if it's an option) if not, get here before 7 on a Friday and Saturday. Best Fhai food I've had in quite some time.
