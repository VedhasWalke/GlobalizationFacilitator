This was our first visit. Although not on the menu, the chef prepared me Lamb Tika Masala. It was the best I have ever had. The lamb was very tender. My friend ordered Chicken Curry, that also was very good.
I asked for medium spice, which from my experience eating indian, was a bit lite. I would order spicy next time.
The atmosphere is very relaxing, and the restaurant is very clean.
The service was quite good.
We will be returning.
