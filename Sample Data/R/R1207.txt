I absolutely love this place! I've been here more than five times in the last two month, it is absolutely super.
I traveled throughout India for roughly a year after college and fell in love with the food. If I can't find a good place around, I'm almost tempted not to take the job or move to the area! I am that obsessed.
When I was looking at a new position in Princeton, I was taken here by my to-be employer. It secretly sealed the deal for me... ok, well, not that far but it helped.
I personally love their chicken korma and sagwala, never had better. better try their pakora! Oh, the mint chutney is superb too, don't forget to order extra.
The atmosphere is great! despite the iffy outside facade, walk inside and you can have a business meeting or nice date.
