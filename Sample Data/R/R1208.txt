SUPER DISAPPOINTING buffet.
Its a good Vegetarian buffet but if you are a carnivore as me stay clear.
1. Not A Single Non Veg Appetizer
2. Non Veg Entree includes:
Butter Chicken and Lamb, some creamy gravy definitely nothing to do with Indian food.
And that is it for Non-Vegetarians options.
I mean common guys there has to be some standard when it comes to Indian buffet, chicken tandoori or tikka and a biryani has to be a staple on Indian buffet.
The food is good but nothing authentic here a good American Desi food at best, definitely NOT a buffet option
