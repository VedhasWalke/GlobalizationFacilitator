I went here for the 2nd time. This place is huge with lots of parking spots. Lunch special is good for a reasonable price. With colleagues i had a good time enjoying lunch with social time. I can say food is 90 percent authentic since they have noodle and fried rice like a chinese restaurnt. But it is worth to visit here.
