Formerly known as the Pind, this Indian bar/ restaurant is now Palace of Asia, with new owners who are working hard to make it a successful venture.
It's a very convenient location for us, but maybe a little out of the way for some, in sleepy Kingston. Regardless, there is a huge free parking lot, as well as a sports bar attached to the dining and banquet rooms. In the sports bar you can get some traditional bar eats, but also order of the excellent and varied Indian menu. There's a daily happy hour from 4 to 7 and it's a bargain. House wines are $4 a glass ( large pour) as are a few draft beers and well drinks. Perhaps not for the wine snob, but if you're just going to catch a drink or two after work with some friends or a date, you can't go wrong.
So after a quick stint at the bar, we settled down for dinner in the elegant dining room. Very cozy and intimate! Far above the typical strip mall ambience you usually find along Rt. 27.
The veggie pakora were light and not at all greasy. Delicious. The papadam was also very light, thin and crispy. Sauces accompanying these dishes had a nice balance of sweet and spicy.
My chicken biryani was perfectly cooked, with a depth of varied flavors that fans of this dish expect but don't always get. It was a large portion and prob enough for two.
My wife's Shrimp Vindaloo was also good although perhaps less successful. The shrimp were large but slightly underdone and they did not fully pick up the flavor of the vindaloo sauce.
Service was very polite and friendly, from an experienced server. No complaints there.
There are a lot of great choices for Indian food in CNJ, but the addition of a large sports bar area, and a much nicer than avg dining room elevates PoA a notch above most. We'll definitely return.
