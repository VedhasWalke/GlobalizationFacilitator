Vatan is a second location after Jersey City. Nothing to do with Vatan in NYC. We did a takeout from here. Our choice included Panipuri, Sev Puri, Vatan Thali, Pav Bhaji, Dal Dhokli and Vada Pav. All in all very good food. My wife is a Gujarathi and she approved their Gujarathi fair with full marks. Panipuri is out of the world. You get 6 different pani flavours and all of them are equally good.  Vatan thali is good for two...very authentic taste and fresh food. Vada pav was better than other classic restaurants in the US. Dal Dhokli was edible but not like the way my mom in law or wife makes. Overall decent food. Challenge is will they maintain the quality.
