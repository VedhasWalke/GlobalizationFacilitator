This place is COVID-19 safe. This is the first time I have ordered from here, so I was skeptical. I ordered pav baji, gobi manchurian, chaat and paneer. The pav baji was perfect, delicious. The amount of spice and flavor perfectly balanced in the dish. The paneer was good , but the gravy was on the sweeter than I expected. The manchurian was amazing. Chaat was a great appetizer.
