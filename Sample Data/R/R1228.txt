My buddy recommended this place and so glad that he did, it was fantastic!
The Harabhara kabab was like a ball made from spinach, potatoes and green peas. It went well with the tamarind chutney and the mint one.
Panir tikka was homemade cheese which tasted more like tofu because of the texture, it was packed with flavor!
The onion kulcha was a type of naan with onions and coriander and was very delicious, first time having it and never saw it when I was in India.
The panir masala and Navratan korma vegetarian style were also packed with flavor and were very thick without a ton of oil like most places make.
The ground lamb Seekh kebab was way too spicy and ended up not finishing it.
Asked for the Indian pickle AKA Mango Pickle or Aam Ka Achaar. It was perfectly flavored and not too spicy.
Can't wait to come back to this place.
