Forced to pay tip!!! Super shady!!!
I've been coming here since this place opened. Food and service has always been good. However, this last time i noticed that tip was already added to my bill. I understand if this was a large group but I was eating alone this time. Also, it was already charged to my card so you couldn't not pay it unless you had them reverse the charge. Furthermore, if you're not careful and only look at the credit card slip then there's a good chance you'll double tip.
I usually tip 15-18% even though it's a buffet. I wonder how many times me and my friends have double tipped.
Feeling cheated. I don't know if I'll be back.
