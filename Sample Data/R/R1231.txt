Lowering the stars to 1. It has gone worse. Nothing has Improved. Horrible quality of food and taste. We went to weekend buffet. Only two non veg dishes....chicken is obnoxious like rubber and they had a salmon curry which also tasted v bad. Veg items were OK but v bland and everything tasted the same.
Will not visit every again!!!
Compared to other Indian buffets around this one is better.
Pros -  Decor of the restaurant is very classy.
In the buffet, I loved their Goan fish curry and lamb pasinda. Also chole bhature was an unique item that they served.
Cons - Appetizers were not good - chicken reshmi kebab was v tough and bland. Aloo tikki was OK. For dessert they had fruit custard of light green color which was smelling obnoxious because of the artificial flavor that was added. Chicken tikka masala was a boring orange gravy which tasted same as other places.
