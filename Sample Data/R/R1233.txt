The service and food at Jhopri is outstanding.  My dad recently, threw my fiancee and I an engagement party in their private room.
Everything from appetizers, to entrees, to dessert was so amazing.  Many of my friends who had either never had Indian food before and even those who had, were raving about how delicious everything was.
And, you certainly don't have to worry about food quantity when hosting a party at Jhopri. There was probably twice as much food than we actually needed.  I wonder what they did with all that leftover.  
Their service was phenomenal as well.  Appetizers and dinner were both set up at the requested times. We weren't lacking for anything and if we needed anything, they were happy to assist. They also had nice floating candle table centerpieces, which was a nice surprise.
Another plus, was that we were able to bring our own liquor and set-up a make-shift bar.  A nice cost savings!!
