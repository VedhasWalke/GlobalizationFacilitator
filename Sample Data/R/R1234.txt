I have no idea htf they got 4 star.....worst service ever they have no idea what are good and what dish they are serving  they are not even close to Indian taste.... they serve naan when u order onion kulcha ..... I am sure most of the ratings are by non Indian..... we ordered chicken tawa, chicken biryani, paneer tikka, onion kulcha, lamb ghosh and chicken Karahi..... trust me none of the dishes were close to indian taste..... best thing was grilled onion u get chicken and paneer tikka..... Biryani is turmeric rice and chicken......
