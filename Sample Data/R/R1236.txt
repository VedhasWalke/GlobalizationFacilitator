Friendly, attentive very respectful staff who made the dinner pleasant and comfortable. 5 stars and hats off to you. The restaurant was beautifully decorated and clean, and perfect for all kinds of crowds.
I like ordering bhindhi masala (okra with lots of spices) when I'm trying to evaluate an Indian restaurant because it's so flavorful and tasty when done right. Jhopri did not disappoint -- the okra was fresh (as opposed to the frozen kind), onions and peppers cooked thoroughly, and the spices (cumin, mustard seeds) were bold.
The basmati rice was also delicious, although it would have been nice to have some cumin seeds in there. The garlic naan had loads of fresh, yellow minced garlic (perhaps it's tumeric + garlic naan?) It was also tasty.
Jhopri is at least a 4-star restaurant, but with the excellent service and cleanliness I'm bumping it to a 5.
Please don't change your prices though -- they are just reasonable enough given the portion sizes.
