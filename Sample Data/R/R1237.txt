My friend said it best, "I don't eat Indian food anywhere else because I only want to eat at Jhopri when I visit you!" Everyone I know who likes Indian food... absolutely LOVES Jhopri. I celebrated a couple of special occasions here, and their velvet decor with ornate serve-ware gave the events a lux feeling. So having lunch here on a regular day is a real treat. The quality of the food is excellent and the staff is all smiles. Lunch buffet is the best time to go because of the variety... typically 2 types of rice, a few types of chicken, several vegetarian choices, a couple of fritter choices, at least one lamb, always fresh naan and always a fresh salad bar. And save room for dessert because the creamy rice pudding, mixed fruit pudding, and gulab jamun are all pretty rich!
