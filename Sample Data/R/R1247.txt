Was here for dinner around Wednesday 5pm. Since it was an early dinner, no one was around except us.
As an appetizer, we had aloo tiki which is fried potato patties and green peas. They were very tasty. Garlic naan came out cold and didn't tasted good.
As an entree, we had palak panic, Indian cheese cooked with mild spices. Didn't see or tasted any spinach as mentioned on the menu.
Tandoori mixed grill was ok- the salmon was too salty and lamb was not tender. Had better tandoori elsewhere.
The bill came out $60 with a tip. Probably have to eat here at lunch buffet for fresher and a variety of dishes.
Also, the service was poor. Even though there was no other customers  around, the waiter never came by to ask if we needed anything. I had to call him  2-3 times.
