A few friends and I decided to eat here before pregaming for a night out on the town. And boy was that a mistake. The food was so darn good, it put us in a food coma. I don't know what it is about the atmosphere at Jhopri but it will put you into a trance. We couldn't find the will power to get plastered later that night, but all worth it.
We ordered the palak paneer, chicken makhani, paneer tikka, garlic naan, and one other paneer dish. Portion size was big but not overwhelming. And our waiter was very kind. This place really does put you into some sort of transcendental consciousness. Definitely coming back here again!
