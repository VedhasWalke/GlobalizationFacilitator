I love it when, on rare occasions, I end up in Plainsboro at midday because it means I can go to Crown of India.  The buffet is huge and the setting is very nice.  However, since they upgraded the interior of the restaurant, the prices have been high enough to make me notice (but not high enough to keep me away).
