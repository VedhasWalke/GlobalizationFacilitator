Jhopri is a beautiful little restaurant in a Plainsboro area. This is a relatively new Indian restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is beautifully decorated and is very pleasant. The food was outstanding and the service was efficient at the dinner time. We ordered a few typical Indian dishes from the menu. Paneer Tikka and kofta's were cooked to perfection. Bread baskets were filled with very authentic breads of India. We also tried the mango lassi and one other desert. Both were very good.
This place is a BYO so feel free to bring a bottle of wine or any other alcohol to enjoy with your meal. We would certainly like to return to this place. Will try for a weekday next time around for a different experience!
