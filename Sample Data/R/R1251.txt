We went to Jhopri for Valentine's Day last year.  Despite having several open tables, they seated us literally in the WAITING AREA, next to the reception desk.  The restaurant is on the corner of the building, and there are two entrance/exit doors with ZERO buffer between the outdoors and the inside of the restaurant.  With every guest (very often on this busy night for restaurants), the door would open and a gust of freezing wind blew over us.  We wore our coats for dinner and grabbed the table napkins for warmth.
We requested several times to be moved to any of the open tables inside the restaurant to get away from our cold and windy location. Apparently, because we had already ordered drinks and appetizers, they could not move us because the food was already coming to our table in 'the system' and they couldn't change it.
The food was alright, the lassi was terrible, but the worst lingering taste of all was being treated like garbage.
