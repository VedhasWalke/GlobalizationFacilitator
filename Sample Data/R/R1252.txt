The best Indian food I've experienced in NY or NJ. The flavors are spot on and portions are as expected. Their lunch buffet is the most well stocked I've been at, and their dinner menu is an excellent representation of the many flavors of India. Don't miss the paneer cooked in the clay oven or the Fish Tikka, an amazing dish that is as good as my beloved Maharana in Madison, Wisconsin.
