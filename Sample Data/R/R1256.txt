I wasn't surprised to see the old italian cafe that lived here go out as my colleague got deathly ill after eating there..........we were so happy that an indian restaurant opened in its place and I am happy to say that I've been coming here since they opened a few years ago....without any illness after eating!
Working so close to here, and having gone to all of the other area Indian buffets, most of my colleagues and I can agree that this is simply the best indian buffet in the area in terms of price to variety ratio.  Service leaves a lot to be desired, no one has ever been overly friendly - but....we go during lunch time when it's a buffet.  There isn't much interaction to be had with the wait staff.
The food is always piping hot, and I've never seen anything not get replenished in a timely manner.  Forgive me as I'm not up on the exact name of the dishes, but my all time fav is the potato & veg ball in the yellow sauce.  Simply delicious.  The lamb curry is also top of my list, as is the original chaat.  
Let's talk about the ambiance and decor as well - it had a serious reno and the decor is simply beautiful and comfortable.  Glad to say that over the years the decor has held up, and looks just as it did on day one.
