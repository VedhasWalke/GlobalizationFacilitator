I wanted to take my oldest son and a family friend out to lunch. She recently moved to Plainsboro and I know this area has a large Indian population so we figured we would easily find some yummy Indian cuisine. My son recommended Jhopri. We went for lunch and there was a fairly extensive lunch buffet available. They eat meat, I do not; however there were lots of options for all three of us. There were lots of servers and they were very attentive. The serving dishes were kept full and the food was indeed tasty. My only complaint and reason for not giving this place a full five stars is that there was no hand soap in the women's bathroom. I'm a bit of germaphobic so that kind of freaked me out. I feel like you can tell a lot about the behind the scenes cleanliness of the restaurant by how they maintain their bathrooms. Otherwise good experience and we would totally go back again
