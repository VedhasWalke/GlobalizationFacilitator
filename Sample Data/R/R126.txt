Whenever we don't feel like cooking we get takeout from Crown of India. We've gotten their food maybe once a month for the past year. Always hot, big portions, and tasty. The naan is good.  My MIL and I love the rice. We usually get the Aloo Gobi and Saag Paneer.  These dishes are not AMAZING but definitely good enough that we get Crown of India cravings every once in a while that no other takeout can satisfy.  I would recommend this place to others. Getting a dish from there is like settling into a warm dish of comfort food--Indian style.
