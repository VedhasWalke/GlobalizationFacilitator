Called tonight around 7:15pm to make reservations for a party of 8. Their response was SORRY WE CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ANY PARTY OF 6 OR MORE. I've never been to this restaurant but I guess I or anyone I know never will. I guess if I split up my party, they could've easily accommodated us?? We'll be going to Mirchi because they never disappoint!
