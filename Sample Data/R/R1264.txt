Was very disappointed in the taste of the food. I had the lunch buffet and tried the palak paneer, malai kofta, aloo ghobi, and shahi paneer. All were pretty bland. The kheer, which is usually one of my favorite desserts was also bland. The fruit cocktail in the mango sauce was good and so were the spinach and potato balls but that was it. I won't be going there again.
