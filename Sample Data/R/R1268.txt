After a lot of words of mouth from my friends on prior occasion, this place is the reason why I consider Plainsboro is my home. The food has authentic North Indian flavour, it's fresh & delicious as always. There is nothing I can say that adequately describes how wonderful this place is. The service is professional and friendly.
