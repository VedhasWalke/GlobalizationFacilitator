Quality of good is inconsistent, some days are ok, other days are not, it seems they change the cook and each cook does things differently.  They also started charging automatically 15% gratuity on your lunch buffet, after taxes.  So the lunch buffet is $11.95 which is attractive but the final bill is $14.95. There really isn't much service going on and they kind of don't do much, so I think this mandatory gratuity is unjust, they should let people tip based on their will.  The quality of food seems to be going down as well, sometimes they are lukewarm, other times I feel difficulty digesting their food afterward.
