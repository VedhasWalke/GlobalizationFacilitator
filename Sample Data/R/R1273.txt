I was in town just for a day and decided to search on Yelp for a lunch spot. Jhopri was closest and rated well so I decided to give it a try. And boy am I glad I did! As someone that travels a lot and eats Indian food a lot, I have to say that this is probably the best lunch buffet I've eaten at in a long time.
Being a vegetarian, I was delighted to have several options for appetizers as well as 7 or 8 vegetarian entree! The hara-bhara veg kabob was tasty as were the mixed pakoras. All of the entrees were delightful. I loved the shahi paneer, saag paneer, navratan korma, chole, etc. I don't think there was anything I tried that wasn't great tasting. Even the dessert (kesar semolina- sevaiyyan) was very good. If I were a local, I'd come here all the time.
The price was very reasonable too - under $15 after tax and gratuity. Highly recommend it.
