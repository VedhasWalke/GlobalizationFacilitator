Worst experience! Reserved a table for two on Valentine's Day dinner, arrive 15 mins before our reservation time to check in but no receptionist to check in. After about 30 mins a wait staff noticed a small group of us standing and came to put us on waiting list. I told them about my reservation but they didn't honor. They somehow manage to give us a table after 30mins of waiting. Our table was in the extended cold end of the restaurant. Wait staff took out order, after 15 mins wait we got our appetizer but wrong appetizers, since we had placed main course order at the same time, 15 to 20 mins later, wait staff brought out main course, but incomplete and waiter didn't show up to check on us. Food quality was worst as well. I don't know how people are giving 4 stars for this place. Ruined the night dinner. I will never go back or recommend.
