This place used to be a 3 or 4 a few months ago.  But success which all go after comes back off a chunk of my backside!
Location is excellent right besdie the well attended public library and these 100s of apart ments in tbe area.
Food (buffet twice over approx 4 months) suckked and then some.
Wirh a nice get up like it has, it should be ok for while.
The asain fusion and 5 guys burger place all ear off jhopris plate!
Main reson for the 2 is the very very ordinay food.  If the managemt ever reads this - thats the easiest problem to fix and stabilize.
