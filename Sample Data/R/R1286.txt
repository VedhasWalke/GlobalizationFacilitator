A great place for a weekday work lunch buffet!!
The buffet is great with a variety of stews with rice and bread. Some of my favorites are their vegetarian options like their chick pea stew.
Their desserts tend to be on the WAY too sweet side...seriously. So I opt for their mixed fruit dessert option.
Overall the service is good but sometimes the staff don't pay attention to when customers have gotten up for another plate and so we find ourselves returning to the table with the old plate still there.
I would recommend this place to a friend.
