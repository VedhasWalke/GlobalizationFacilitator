5 stars for a Indian buffet..... Crazy right?
No, not crazy in the least as Jhopri was that good.
Located in the old A&G spot and very tastefully decorated with comfortable banquettes,tufted wall panels in greys,golds and blues the restaurant appears light,airy and not overly done.
The Buffet starts with a condiment table with the usual chutneys and chaats but also offered a very tasty whole grilled pepper,lime chutney and savory red chili pepper paste which made me believe that this was not going to be your standard tamed south Asian buffet.
I was proved right as the line of offerings like a deeply braised lamb in a aromatic cumin masala,Goa fish curry,lime scented grilled chicken,paneer and tofu in a rich tomato curry with just enough peppers to make you believe in the chef's vision,sauteed eggplant and potatoes with a light onion based sauce,a thick and flavorful lenten pea dahl and a creamy and tart mango custard....and the list goes on.
The kitchen layered the flavors correctly and every dish stood alone instead of just blending into one curry flavored carbo load as most Indian buffet tend to.
Every table received a pair of light and airy potato stuffed Puris and a basket of steaming hot Naans. A nice touch.
BYOB but with a bar already set up in their renovations a liquor license might be forthcoming.
Service was quick and efficient and management was obviously delighted with the many compliments received as satisfied diners departed.
Jhopri has raised the bar for not only Indian Buffets but judging from their slick and well composed menu every Indian restaurant as well.
I think I'll be a regular.
