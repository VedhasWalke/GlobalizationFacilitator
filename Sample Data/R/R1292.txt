I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Jhopri since I first heard about it. The owners of Jhopri also own Cross Culture down Harrison St. in Princeton which is a great Indian restaurant!
I came to Jhopri with some vegetarian friends and for vegetarians there are a lot of options. I chose the Tandori Chicken as my entree which came out very hot, so much that it was smoking at the table. The chicken was accompanied by onions, peppers and rice. The table ordered some paneer for our appetizer, naan and roti to share.
The ambience is unique and not expected from a restaurant in Plainsboro. The colors used are blue and gold, very exotic looking. I felt like I was in an Indian restaurant in the city, not in suburbia. My only complaint is that the restaurant was cold! The heat could have been turned up a few degrees.
The owners are so nice! My friend frequents both Cross Culture and now Jhopri and they brought out the royal treatment to our group by making items that were not even on the menu and giving us a free dessert (Gulab Jamun)! I love supporting local businesses, especially when the workers are willing to go above to make the experience enjoyable.
