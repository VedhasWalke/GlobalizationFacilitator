Beautiful restaurant, dimly lit for an intimate feel. My husband and I ordered the chicken tikka app that had great flavor and was served sizzling hot. For the main we had palak panir which was spicy the way we had ordered it. It was good, not great, especially since it seemed to have some cream in it which really takes away from the dish.  The other main was the malai chicken kabob which I was really looking forward to but this kind of kabob is supposed to be very tender and it was kind of tough and way too mild in taste.  My husband loved his chicken karahi, it was tender and well-spiced. Gulab jamun was very good and served warm.
I would go back and try their other dishes.  Service was attentive and friendly. There is a liquor store very close by which makes it convenient for this BYOB place.
