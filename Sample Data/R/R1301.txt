We went there with couple of our friends as we had heard good reviews about the place. The food options were limited but the taste was fine. Problem started when we were eating and no one turned up to clear the plates.
All the staff was watching match on tv and the service was slow. When the bill came there was 18 percent tip charged though were five people and that charge was for a party of 6 plus. We have to point it out and argue about it to get it deducted. Also they charged 10 $ for buffet for a 3 year old child.
The ambience was good but the service can definitely be improved
