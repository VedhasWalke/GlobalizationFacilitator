This indian food is much better than most in the area. It has a great flavor and they can make food mild or extremely spicy based on your taste. I like mild so I get mild food and my boyfriend likes spicy so he gets it very spicy. Once he complained that it was not spicy enough and they brought him a small dish of chopped spicy peppers to put in his food. They are very nice and accommodating. Worth the price you pay for the food. The portions are large.
