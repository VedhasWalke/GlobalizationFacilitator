We've been here a couple of times. The food is good. The service we've had before was slow but nothing too bad. That said, the service we had last night was absolutely atrocious. It's clear that this restaurant could not handle a large party in the room next door in addition to regular business. First, the appetizer took an excessively long time. I could live with that. Things happen. Then, we needed more water but no one even came near us for like 20 minutes. Next, the entrees came out. They were a bit spicier than we would like (most Indian restaurants I've been to ask a spice level), but that's my fault. I could have specified milder. I had a biriyani and my boyfriend had chicken vindaloo. The rice for the vindaloo never made it to the table and we couldn't even ask for it because once again, no one came near our table or could be found. We were also out of water. Our waiter never checked on us throughout the meal. We saw him to order and to ask for the check. That's it. I like the food here, but there are many Indian restaurants to choose from in this area. I'm not sure I'd go back with this level of service.
