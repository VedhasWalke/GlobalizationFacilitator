Went for a family dinner. There was a party going on in the back of the restaurant which had a separate entrance but the party guests kept walking past our table so moved to a different table on reluctantly being accommodated for that request. Relatively high priced menu for an Indian restaurant but no complementary condiments (onion, papad, chutneys, etc.) Food tasted good however could have been better e.g., the paneer in palak paneer was raw. It should have been fried first. Rice had clumps and was not steaming hot. Invest in a rice cooker/steamer like Chinese restaurants. Also, a small bowl of rice for 4 people with 4 curry orders. Had to ask for more.The servers were gruff, too. Wonder why. Just stared when complimented for taste of food.  It is these small things that differentiate from good to great.
