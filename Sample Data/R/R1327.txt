The restaurant opened on Sunday and I was walking by and decided to walk inside. This by far is one of the nicest Indian restaurants I have been too. Once you step inside you feel like it is a New York City restaurant.
The owners also own Cross Culture in Princeton. First the place is BYOB!
I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, rice, garlic naan and ordered their hot sauce. They make this special hot sauce using chilis, tomato paste, little cream and it is incredible. It is spicy but one of the best Indian sauces I have had.
If you have a meeting with clients or a business lunch I highly recommend bringing them here.
I am a huge fan of Cross culture now I don't have to drive so far. Crown of India better step their game up because this place is going to run circles around all the Indian restaurants in the area.
