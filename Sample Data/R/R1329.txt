I was so excited when I walked past this place and saw there was a new Indian restaurant in town. I LOVE Indian but haven't been able to find a good restaurant in this area besides cross culture, which I believe has the same owner.
For appetizers we ordered vegetable samosas, and for entrees we had chicken tikka masala, Navratan Korma, bhindi masala, and a creamy lamb dish that wasn't on the menu. We also had naan on the side. Everything was delicious and we ended up eating more than we wanted because the food was so great.
We were one of three groups in the restaurant on a Sunday night, but I hear they get busy on Friday and Saturday, and weekday lunches. Sunday night is definitely a good time if you want a quieter atmosphere and personalized attention.
Service was wonderful, decor was beautiful. I definitely plan on eating here a LOT more.
