From the same owner's as Cross Culture, Jhopri is definitely a great place to go for quality Indian food. Plus, their lunch buffet is an absolute steal with the variety of food and available vegetarian options. I've enjoyed the buffet several times and I always leave feeling stuffed and satisfied. The staff is always on their game - my water glass never empty. On one occasion, one waiter was particularly fond of my 2-year old god daughter who was talking an earful and gave her a mango drink for her to enjoy on the house. The decor is nice with large booths and 2 seat tables on the perimeter. If you order take out, I highly recommend their Chicken Makhani!
