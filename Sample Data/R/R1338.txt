The restaurant is another branch for the Cross Culture in Princeton Shopping Center. The food is great! As well as the people there! We ordered shrimp sagwaala, chicken sagwaala, and lamb curry. The flavor can be adjusted according to customers.

Since the first visit, I've been here several times: as often as once a week. The lunch buffet is terrific!! Various dishes to try on each visit. They hardly repeat.
