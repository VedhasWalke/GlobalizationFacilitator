We tried Saturday lunch buffet on 02/25, overall decent experience.
Price was $13.99+tax per person.
Positives:
- Nice service
- Good ambience
- Good mix of dishes for the price; three desserts items with four starters, two non veg main course dishes, three veg main course options, rice and naan
Negatives:
- one could taste individual ingredients in the dishes because these dishes were not cooked properly e.g. Bhindi masala, I was able to taste raw flavor of turmeric
- vegetable balls in Chinese dish were not done properly and had too much salt
- often times they were out of naan
Overall I would recommend this place but there is definitely room for improvement or else other restaurants will certainly steal some customers from Jhopri.
