This was our first visit to their luncheon buffet. First, I'll talk about the decor. The seating is comfortable, with pleasant surroundings, although a little dark. Now, the staff. We walked in and the only greeting was the word "two?" We were shown to a table with no explanation of the offerings, or simply, "enjoy your lunch and if you have any questions, please ask". We had our lunch and asked for the check, which came without a "thank you, or was everything satisfactory. When we left, there were staff by the podium, yet no one said "thank you, come again, or have a nice day". None of the staff looked happy, or energetic.
The food. The selection was good, with ample meat and veg items. We tried the following:
The rice, some kind of short grain, unlike any Basmati that we've ever had. It was also undercooked.
Vegetable noodles, very good, but oily.
Chicken Tikka Masala, the chicken was somewhat dry and the sauce was bland.
Chicken Maharaja, my favorite of the meal.
Lamb Curry, very good.
Vegetable Korma, tasty, but oily.
That's part of what we sampled. There were no other standouts, except an okra dish that was good. Overall, we weren't impressed and are not inclined to return.
