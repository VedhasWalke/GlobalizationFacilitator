Food was superior to the usual take out Indian fare. We ordered an assortment of appetizers and shared several entries. Everything was well done and served with excellent hospitality. The atmosphere was just the right touch. And, what a treat their kufti was! Usually it's too iced hard and I can't even eat it. But this one was like suckling on ice- fun, tasty, smooth.
