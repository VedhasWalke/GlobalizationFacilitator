I am probably one of the most frequent customers of Jhopri and imo, it is the best Indian restaurant in the area. I have always found the food at the buffet excellent and the staff to be extremely friendly and great at taking care of guests. I am a big fan of their samosa and their Chicken Chops, when they have them for the buffet.
I am an even bigger fan of their dinner menu. Their Chicken Makhani is the best butter chicken version I have ever had. Other things that are excellent on the menu include Chicken Cashmere, the Biryanis, Malai Kofta, Navratan Korma, Kashmiri Dum Aloo, and Bhindi Masala.
Only one word of warning: The queue for the lunch buffet can sometimes get long so one must be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated, especially on Fridays when a lot of the people who work in the area seem to come here with their colleagues.
