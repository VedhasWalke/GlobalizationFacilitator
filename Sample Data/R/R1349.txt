Really great Indian restaurant.  Wow.  Maybe the best Chicken Makhala I've ever had!  We were visiting the area and ate here on a Saturday evening and had no trouble being seated, which is a surprise given the food quality and attentive service.  Reasonable prices but BYOB.  I would come back without hesitation.
