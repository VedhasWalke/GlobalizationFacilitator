Jhopri serves very nice Indian buffet. We went for the lunch buffet on a Saturday. Their service was good. Surprisingly they had plenty of veg and nonveg items in the buffet and those were really very good. There was a number of choices in the salads also. The chicken maharaja kebab, lamb curry were extremely tasty. Other items were much better than the average. We also loved the gulab jamun in dessert. We found Jhopri one of the best Indian restaurants in New Jersey at a reasonable price.
