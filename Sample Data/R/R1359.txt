One of the truly great buffets in the area. The buffet has a lot of choices, and they change some things up once in a while. One of the things that sets this place apart is the the dining room itself is beautiful. It looks great, and is very comfortable and cozy. Plenty of room. It is obvious a lot of effort and pride is put into this place.
