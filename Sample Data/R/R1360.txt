we have been here several times and have never been disappointed. I would like to try their lunch buffet sometime. We always come for dinner and simply love the ambiance and you are never rushed.
The chicken Tikka appetizer is on point and the chicken samosas and wonderful. I love the chicken vindaloo and my wife really enjoys the lamb rogan josh. All around a good menu, great food, nice quite ambiance and reasonbly priced. Highly recommend for dinner.
