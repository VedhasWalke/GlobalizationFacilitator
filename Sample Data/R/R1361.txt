Pretty let down. Went with family for a Sunday lunch buffet. Same old weekday fare. Better setting, more expensive. Grilled Chicken starter wasn't tandoori & above average. Mutton gravy was below average Rogan ghosh. Chicken & Paneer makhni shared the same gravy & cook. No Biryani, No Seafood, No papad, even on a weekend buffet costing $15, lots of better, cheaper options around.
