Not sure why is there so much hype about the place. I had lunch there with family. The atmosphere is good -- very spacious, lots of open space. It was the hot day and air conditioning didn't work. Anyone familiar with Indian spicy food would know how the experience is going to be. Coming to the food -- the food is fine. Not the best Indian food I have had in a restaurant, but not bad either. Although what I found wired was they kept stocking out of items in buffet. First the replenishment was not fast enough, then they said some items have finished for the day. This was at 2pm -- not much later in the afternoon. I have never seen something like this in any restaurant. This is perhaps indication of some food items being too good, but it is also an indication of poor management.
