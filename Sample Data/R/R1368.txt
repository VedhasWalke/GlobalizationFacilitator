Dinner was delicious! It took us a year to find this restaurant and wish we would have found it sooner! The atmosphere is elegant and doesn't look like your typical Indian restaurant. The service was great and the staff was very accommodating since we had a small child. I can't rave about it enough. We had samosa's which had great flavor, tandoori mix grill, chicken saag, and naan which were all tasty! Our daughter loved the papadam and tamarind sauce. Even took some to go! We will definitely be back soon!
