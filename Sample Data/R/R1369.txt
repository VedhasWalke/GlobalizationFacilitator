I went to this place when I visited princeton/plainsboro for quick vacation trip.  Went for lunch buffet.  I can't really name everything that were on the shelf, but I thought it was pretty similar to other indian places that offer lunch buffet.  Also I thought the quality of food was about the same as other places around the area.
