Lovely people; lovely restaurant; VERY mediocre basic Northern Indian food. The Chicken Biryani is classic old school with large chunks of flavorless chicken and minimal and boring spices. Is it edible yes, would I come back, no. The Tandoori Chicken was also average and - and yes I get the humor here - the pieces were TINY (the price was not) and the onion and peppers included were RAW. The additional flavor and subtlety provided via a skosh of caramelizing with a little ghee is huge and would help. The Chicken Sagwala was the best of the lot but still ... very 1990s. Unfortunately for Jhopri the influx of Southern Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi cooking in the Eastern U.S. has simply elevated the palates of any well-traveled well-fed foody, and this is a throwback that I'm sure will sell to the less adventurous in the hinterlands but not to anyone with any other option. A Kashmiri Naan - not listed on the menu - was lovely in parts and raw and flavorless in others.
I note that this restaurant is so brand new it's using its sister restaurant's menus, and so with time and experience it's possible this review will deserve to be - as it will be - relegated down the list.
