Brought to you by the owner of Cross Culture in Princeton, Jhopri is hands down just as good as CC and worth the half hour drive for us. Everything is fresh, spiced how we like it, and the service is good. Aloo tiki chaat appetizer is our favorite and a must try. Overall, we love this place and highly recommend. I give a five star for dinner, but would only give four stars for the lunch buffet. It's the best Indian buffet I have tried, but it's still a buffet which takes its toll on the food. Prefer the lunch to order system at Cross Culture and they should bring that option to Jhopri as well. Still, worth a visit if you like Indian. You won't be disappointed.
