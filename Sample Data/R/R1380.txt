Good ambience; that's it. Food: thumbs down. It's not authentic, not worth the price. Gave them three chances and disappointed. Daal without any herbs and spices that are essential in this staple of North Indian food. Roasted meat platter had overcooked meat, raw onions and veggies, no sizzle. Rice was white thick rice, not Basmati. That's certainly not what one would expect in fine Indian dining. Better dining options are available not too far.
