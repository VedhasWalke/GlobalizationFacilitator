Their lunch buffet is amazing. Affordable, authentic, and high quality, this is truly the best lunch deal for miles around. Free and fresh, piping hot naan comes with the meal. They have a lot of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for the appetizers and main dishes. I've really enjoyed the chickpeas at the salad bar, the fried spinach balls, the paneer masala, aloo gobi, and gulab jamun. They always check on their food and it's never left out there to sit for hours. The food is also well-heated; the last time I was there, the gulab jamun was heated very well, a relief from gummy, lukewarm versions at other Indian buffets. They rotate their selections every day, which is wonderful and definitely encourages us to go back every week! The friendly service and sleek interior doesn't hurt either. I'm so glad we have Jhopri in the area!
