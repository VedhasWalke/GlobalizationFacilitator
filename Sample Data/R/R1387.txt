Fine Indian dining has arrived at Plainsboro.  Excellent decor, service and food.  We enjoyed our favorites on this first visit palik paneer and chicken korma. Both prepared exactly as requested.  Roti really nice and crisp the way we like it.  Music very enjoyable.
We will come soon to check out the buffet.
