I was already a huge fan of Cross Culture, the sister restaurant in Princeton.  I recently tried Jhopri's lunch buffet, and it was delightful.  The food was superb -- both the selection and the quality.  They have also done an excellent job of creating a pleasant atmosphere in a suburban "strip mall" type location.  As long as they continue this trend of excellence, I will be a regular visitor.
