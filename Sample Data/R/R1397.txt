After reading so many good reviews recommended by Yelp, I decided to give it a try by having the lunch buffet today on this beautiful Sunday with my friends who are Indian food fans. The ambience is better than many Indian restaurants. However, it's not impressing. The varieties are very little on Sunday. I couldn't imagine how many choices they would offer during weekday. I'd a lot of Indian buffet at North Jersey and the varieties of food that they offer is at least double of what Jhopori offers. The only thing I like is the brown rice which they cook with Indian herb. I believe it's cinnamon and certain curry leaves which smells so good. I was disappointed as there is no choices of fish nor kerela and the surprising part is the Indian food aren't spicy. Last, the mango dessert is way too sweet which mix with can fruits. Overall I feel like it's Americanized and not an authentic Indian cuisine. 4 of us left unsatisfied and have a couple runs to the restroom which might due to the food isn't hygiene. None of us would be back.
