Amazing place. Good food and stellar customer service. The owner is a very sweet and nice person named Naveen chopra. We could not sit inside due to coronavirus restrictions, but they do have some outdoor seating. We ordered gol gappa, dahi puri, chilli paneer and chilli garlic noodles. Will visit again. We incidentally found this gem when we visited six flags and started craving Indian food
