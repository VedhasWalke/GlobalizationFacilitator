I rarely give 5 stars and this is one such place . Very good food . First time in NJ we experienced the MAHARAJA THALI. 36 items . 70$ but 5 of us ate . Something different . Wish they had an ice cream and some more sweets in the maharaja thali...
Kids thali was also good . Nice and courteous service. Quick service too. Lots of parking available and lots of tables to sit. They also have a banquet hall if someone is interested. See my full review here:
