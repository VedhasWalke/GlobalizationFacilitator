Really sad and disappointing New Years dinner. Only reason for 2 starts is the service. When I complained to the server, he very politely took my criticism into consideration and said he would tell the management. But avoid this place if you want actual authentic, flavorful Indian food. This place is catering to "white people" which is exactly what management told me when I said all the food is bland. Made 0 sense to me because when I looked around, entire place was filled with brown people.
So here goes. I'm a jersey girl who has grown up in this area her whole like. I work in nyc so I get to eat a lot of amazing Indian food in the city and in the Princeton area. I've always felt you can compare the two regions because there are so many amazing and high quality Indian restaurants in central Jersey also. Considering Kesar's location and 5 star reviews, I definitely thought I was going to be impressed. Unfortunately it was the opposite. My husband and I went out with our parents and ended up trying a bunch of things.
1. Chaat thali - terrible. The pani puri water was so bland and on top of that, they only brought our 4 small puris. We had to pay $2 for more.
2. Punjabi thali - horrible. The channa lacked any kind of spice whatsoever. I have never had bland Punjabi chole, that makes no sense. All the other vegetables were also flavorless and very disappointing.
3. Rajasthani thali - decent but nothing to write home about.
4. hot and sour soup - pretty good, saving grace of the dinner. Hakka noodles however were lacking flavor and spice.
The other aggravating part was they brought our pakoras in the middle of our dinner instead of as appetizers which they are supposed to be. We asked them to just take it off our bill/send it back but nope. Won't be returning or bringing any friends or family here.
