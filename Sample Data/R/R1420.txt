An excellent Indian  restaurant, newly opened only about a couple of months ago.
What impressed me most were:
1. Exceptionally gracious proprietors, Naveen Chppra and Meena and the serving staff.  They make you feel at home right away, and like family.  One will have warm feelings which one will not forget.
They really take pains to make the food to order.  I come from the South of India and I like my food to be really spicy - open an oyster at 60 paces.  They delivered.
2. Food is freshly prepared, you can tell and piping hot.  The taste is excellent.
3. Premises very clean and really spacious.
4. The washrooms again are very clean, spick and span.  This is often a failing at many Indian restaurants.
5. Prices are very reasonable for what is offered as total dining experience.
6. Since we mentioned we liked the food they gave us a little extra take home dessert on the house.  We did not expect this but it was very welcome and we will always remember the gesture.
Now for the flip side, there always is one.
1. Portion size could be slightly larger.
2. For a Punjabi vegetarian Indian restaurant they did not / do not serve okra curry.  This is standard fare, both dry fried and / or with broth.
