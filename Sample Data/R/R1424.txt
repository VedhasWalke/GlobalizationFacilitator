What a delectable spread of tasty Indian food we had this evening during our first visit to Kesar's!    
Our party of 6 tried the Paanch Chaat Thali, which was a perfect variety of our favorite Mumbai-style snacks; Kesar's Special Thali filled with authentic Punjabi specialities including the yummiest Punjabi Kadi Pakora and the Gujarati Thali.
The exemplary friendly service from Meena along with the cozy warm ambience and decor, relaxing Indian music, and delicious food made this a definite *repeat-restaurant* for our family.
Highly recommend you try it out but make sure you bring your appetites!!
