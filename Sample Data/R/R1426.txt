Wow was I impressed. Had the thali with paneer stuffed paratha. For the paratha spice level was not shy! Thank goodness for raita. Chana masala was good... paneer makhani was great. Dessert and chai were a great finish. Will definitely be back... happy to have found this place so close to home and with reasonable pricing!
