The best Indian food experience around with a well thought through menu with the most variety I have ever seen. Try the Channa Paneer Bhatura, it is amazing! Try my favorite, Dahi Bhalla! Another mouth watering dish is the Chaat Thali, their Chaats are the best I've had. Oh, and the service, be ready to get treated like you've just returned home after being away a long time. Don't forget to order Dosa too!
