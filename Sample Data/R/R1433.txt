Stale , smelly and unhygienic food !
I had horrible experience with food ! Not to mention service was also horrible. The server sat across other end behind me and was asking if i need anything. Didnt even bother to come to table !
The order was simple for masala dosa . It came with sambar which seemed was stale . But green chutney was worse; cold from freeze and perhaps few days old because it smelled terrible. I understand making sides fresh is not custom but serving stale n smelly food is unacceptable. Its unhygienic & unhealthy place ; from what i experienced! Heath dept should look into this
