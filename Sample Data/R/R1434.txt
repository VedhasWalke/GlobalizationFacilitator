This is one of the very few restaurants where you can truly find Indian cuisine exactly as it tastes in India. We have tried many Indian restaurants but nothing comes close to Kesar in terms of tastes, variety & hospitality. We were lucky to find this restaurant as it is the only one that serves Soya Chaap which we had been desperately searching everywhere & so we drove 2.5 hours on our way to home from our trip which was not on the way to Kesar but that's what we did so we could eat Soya Chaap & it was so worth it. We were so overwhelmed when we tasted the items we ordered like Kesar's Special Thali, Soya Chap sizzler, Soya Chap Makhani and also ordered some more Soya Chap & Indian Sweets for to go.
if you are looking for delicious Indian Cuisine or craving for Indian food, this is the place you should come to.
