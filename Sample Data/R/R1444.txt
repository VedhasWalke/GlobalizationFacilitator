We went there with our friends - around 15 ppl with kids. The food was amazing so was the service. Of all the trillion dishes we ordered , the tandoori paneer (homemade paneer), sarson da saag, parathas ( chilly onion and paneer) were out of this world. All thalis were good too. They had the authentic taste. Wish they had a branch close to Jersey city
