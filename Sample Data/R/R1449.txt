If you're in the mood to go home full this is the place. The portions are big and filling. The paneer burger was not dry at all and full of flavors. Me and my gf both tolerate different levels and spices they considered that when they took our order. Mumbia 7 layer will have to be my goto. First time I ever tried it and it really is 7 layers of flavor. Will come again.
