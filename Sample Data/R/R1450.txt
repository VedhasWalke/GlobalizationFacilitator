We ordered Gujarati thali and Daal baati churma. Upon receipt of Gujarati thali, we noticed it didn't have daal or Kadhi, although mentioned in the description. When we asked it was said they don't have it today and they did not mention it while we placed order. Later upon request they replaced one veg curry to Punjabi kadhi. We wish it was informed to us earlier as mostly the dish was dry. For daal baati again the same issue ,quantity of daal was less and hence need to leave half baati. Baati was also not soft. Considering the cost some improvement in quantity and bit more quality would be appreciated. The food was not bad but neither was having very authenticate taste.
