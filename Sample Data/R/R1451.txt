Came with the family to this restaurant. Lets just say it was an experience to say the least. Ordered papad as a table snack initially didnt get it till dinner fine happens. Then I was explained you can only order papad and only eaten at dinner thats why it wasnt given earlier. Fine confused by that explanation but fine.  Then ordered two apps only got one. Asked about the other so it didnt come out with the entrees. Long behold came out with the entrees. Fine still keeping it together things happen life goes on. The only reason this is rated highly is because the food itself was good. So now either the manager or owner not sure who he was ask how is everything. Me being me I say foods good just took a bit long thats all. Dont know what I triggered in him but I was blamed for the service because of how much I ordered. Umm Three entrees and two apps not sure how thats too much for a family of four. Regardless even if I had ten people and ordered the same amount the timing wouldnt have changed or if I had less people. The service is why I have my issues with this place. The best comment I got and will stick in my mind was by an honest server. She goes atleast you got your food some people dont even get it.
