This place has been opened for two days and I have been here twice. The quality is impeccable. The vegan options are a lot better than the meat options I've had before. The plain dosa is far from plain. Every dish goes 6 steps above the regular Indian dish. Must try the roomali roti. It's a vegan version of chicken tikka masala. You will not miss or even think about the meat. I kept asking the waitress about the dish. I could not believe that something that creamy could be vegan.
