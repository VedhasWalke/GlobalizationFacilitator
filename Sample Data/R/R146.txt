Really pathetic service. The lady at the counter was behaving as if she was doing me a great favor by taking my order. No smile. Which might have been ok if not for her tone. She was downright rude. I had a gift voucher and she told me it was expired. Which is fine but her tone made me feel I would be shot for it. All said and done I will go back again because the only thing I order there is really good (Pakodas). So for goo food I shall be back to get humiliated.
