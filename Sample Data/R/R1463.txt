I was really hoping to love this restaurant. My husband went there for Father's Day. When we walked in, our first impression was that this is an attractive, local restaurant that is very busy and that must mean that the food and service are good. Although the restaurant was full, we were the only non-Asians and that indicated to us that the food is exceptional and authentic. We were seated and then basically ignored. We had to ask for menus and later for water. We then requested help with the menu because there is no English explanation on the menu. The owner directed us to the Thali list and very rapidly interpreted. Once we were served, the presentation was beautiful and the breads delicious but no one ever came back to the table. After completing the meal, we had to ask for the check. We felt as if no one cared about us or wanted our business. When I read other reviews that rave about the friendly, attentive staff I wonder if we were in the same place. Or does our business not matter to the owner? Because it was a holiday and super busy, I'll come back again and hope that I'll be treated as a valued customer. If not, I'll be  enjoying Indian food elsewhere.
