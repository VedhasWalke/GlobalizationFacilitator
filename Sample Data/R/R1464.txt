A one time visit restaurant. We ordered Chaas, the lady said they called it lassi and brought it to us. The taste was good but felt it was quite thick and lacked flavor. We ordered Amritsari thali and Punjabi thali, first thing noticed was two of the gravy's were common between the thali's only difference was that Punjabi thali had two additional gravy. We chose mixed kulcha and tawa paratha for breads, both tasted good. The thali had raita which was basically the chaas or lassi with a thicker consistency. When pointed out that both tasted the same, the lady didn't have much but to say that they will ask the chef to change the taste. So $3.95 for Chaas was definitely not worth it. The sweet they gave was jalebi which tasted aged and stuck to the teeth when bitten. The thali is limited and you cannot ask for refill. All in all, charging a buffet price for a limited option thali was totally not worth it. If only they had some exclusive selection of food and better taste this place would have been a second try.
