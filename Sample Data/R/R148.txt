This restaurant has been open for a very short time at the time of this writing, so they must just be getting in the groove of things.
Food: I had ordered Samosa and dry veg Manchurian. The samosa were average. Actually, they tasted awfully similar to the one you get at the Indian grocery store & Cake Walk down the road. I am fairly certain that they were brought in and not prepared at the restaurant. I would stay away from ordering Chinese here. The Manchurian weren't crispy. The texture was very smooth and was lacking flavor.  Serving size is large. I would recommend ordering spicy, it wasn't ridiculously hot.
Ambience: it's a fast food tour setup with proper China and silverware. It is odd to see Planet Fitness paper napkins to clean hands.
Service: the service is great. I was greeted with a smile and person taking the order was very patient.
