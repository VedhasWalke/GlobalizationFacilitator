Average food, I have had food here multiple times. Sometimes they really serve good food sometimes below average. The quick bite items on the menu are good. Dal makhani, chicken tikka masala and other items like it our below average. If you want to proper dine it's better you go somewhere else. There branch near Quakerbridge mall is much better than this.
