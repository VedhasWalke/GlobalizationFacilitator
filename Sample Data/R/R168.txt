The first time ordered a takeaway, the food was amazing. I ordered some biryani for the second time. Five mins after I placed an order, I called to enquire if the online order was confirmed. Surprisingly, they told that the food was already ready. I went and picked up the food and when I came home, the food was bad. The biryani was probably made the previous day. It was horrible to taste. The biryani was soggy. I had requested them to make it spicy. Well, they were ingenious in that. They chopped up chilies into small pieces and made a small heap on the biryani and left it there. They didn't bother to mix it nor sprinkle it evenly.
