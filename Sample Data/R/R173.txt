We have ordered food from this place several times and the food itself has always been delicious. It is strictly a take out place. During Covid, they do not have their act together.  People were crowded into the small inside area, although everyone was wearing masks.  There was no designation for pickup versus those placing orders.  It was a bit chaotic.
We really like their whole Tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala and, of course, the Kebabs.  The entrees do skimp a bit on the meat and have more "gravy." Rice should be ordered separately, since it is included with the order. They have great lunch specials as well.
The place itself could be organized a bit, because it also serves as a butcher shop. At least you know all the meat dishes you order are fresh quality meat.  The place is Halal, as indicated in their name.  If ordering take out during the weekend, make sure you order in advance. The wait time for food pick up is usually 30-45 minutes.
