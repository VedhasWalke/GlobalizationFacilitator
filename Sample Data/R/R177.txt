Stopped here to grab quick lunch for 2 people.
Ordered:
- afghani kebab
- palak paneer
- chicken malai tikka
- naan
I was impressed by the quality of food specially the freshness of the the palak paneer and chicken malai tikka could be felt in every bite.
Not the best I have eaten but a close 2nd for sure
