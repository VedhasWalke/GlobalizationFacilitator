We have been regulars for 5yrs, to this butcher shop no problem but the biggest problem is customers cutting corners/lines to get their meat without making sure other customers who got there first before them as if they have the right to do so (they were all in the line and were in respectful manner by giving space, only to be rudely cut off by arrogant customers). And also getting in the way when we pick up our order/while we pay for it. How rude...mind your manners and have some respect no matter how small/tight space!
