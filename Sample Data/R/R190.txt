This is my go to place for ordering local Indian food. The food is authentic and the chilli level is perfect. However, the meat in the dishes is sparse and you have to pay extra for basmati rice. You need to order at least 30 minutes in advance on the weekends since they're extremely busy but well worth the wait.
