man what do they put in the sauce?
its freaking fantastic. straight up heart clogging ingredients but sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants. and thats some yummy chicken tikka marsala.
its a halal market but they have a section for ordering quick food.
aesthetically, having a take out business on the butcher floor probably isnt the best idea, but there is some sort of beautiful fusion that erupts from this combination to provide me some mind blowing marsala and real naan.
HALLLAAAAL House...i  heart you
im pretty sure this is the best indian food in the immediate area.
