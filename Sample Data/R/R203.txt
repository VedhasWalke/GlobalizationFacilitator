The place looks very-very cheap. It doesn't look like you can order something to go. It's more like some butcher place. But, try their Malay Kabab and Chicken Tikka Masala. It's delicious and much cheaper than regular Indian restaurants nearby. For $6.75 you get a very tasty meal of small chicken yoghurt marinated pieces on a bed of onion and lettuce, plus some (separate served) greenish looking yoghurt dip (very tasty).
The Chicken Tikka is also very good. It's half the price than other places around. I tried their Samosas but they were very-very oilly. Stay away from these deep fried treats there.
As I said, this is not a restaurant, it doesn't even look like a restaurant, but the food is more than good for the price.
