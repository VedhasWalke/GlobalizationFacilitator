Best tasting curries at the lowest prices I have seen anywhere in north America. Every time we visit NJ this is our go to spot. It is not a place you can take your family to but definitely a place from where you can take food home and enjoy.  Their catering prices are also quite cheap. Give this place a try you will keep going back.
