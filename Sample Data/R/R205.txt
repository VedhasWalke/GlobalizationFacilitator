The ambiance is not going to win points with anyone, but you'll need to look past that.  It's good food at a good price.  Love the chicken tikka masala.  If you're home on a weekday, the lunch specials area a steal.  The free "salad" that comes w/ every meal- trash that immediately.  Don't even open the foam container.
They do tend to take a while preparing your order (not necc. a bad thing), so make sure you call ahead and don't show up early.  Otherwise you'll be waiting while staring at goat innards in the cooler case.
