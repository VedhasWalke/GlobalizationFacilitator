Was horrible. Don't ever set foot in this place. Stinks and hot as hell inside and food tastes bad. Saw them handle all the meat with bare hands and they did not seem to care about hygiene.  The meat was also old and tasted so bad like rubber.  And worst part was customer service. A fat lady in the front argues with and yells at customers when she messes up the order.
