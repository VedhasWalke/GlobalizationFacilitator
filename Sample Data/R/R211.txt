I just moved about 15min's from this place and it is wonderful.  My family goes there at least once every two weeks.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is the best I have ever had on the East Coast of US.  
I don't totally understand what Halal meat means but I believe it is similar to kosher meat in that there are rules around how the animals are killed and prepared.  I must say the place is very clean and it seems to be family run.  
Only problem I see is there is no in-house dinning.  It seems to be half butcher shop and half takeout service.
