im a big fan of this place. out of all the indian around here, i always end up here
it pretty much looks like a butcher.....or more like a butcher that just moved in. if you wanna sit down go next door, theres no seats except a couple to sit and wait for your pickup. but getting over the empty front, you can take out some great cooked dishes, killer kabab or just some freshly butchered goat at 9pm on a friday in east windsor
