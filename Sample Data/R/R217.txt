Quite surprised by the low Yelp ratings for The Mint considering the high ratings on delivery service apps. It was my first time ordering from The Mint since it took over the space formerly occupied by Mehek on Nassau Street in Princeton. Food was delivered hot and at the time I specified when ordering online. The onion pakoras appetizer was perfectly prepared and arrived crispy due to the extra care taken in the business packing them over a bed of lettuce. Chicken tikka masala was good, with a slight extra hint of pepper in the gravy compared to other places. The palak paneer was spiced to perfection and tasty. A family member commented it was the best preparation of this dish among restaurants in the area. Most prices are in line with other quality Indian food places in the Princeton area, but in examining the menu, I felt the $4 price tag for naan and drink prices were a bit excessive. Based on first impressions, I'd rate The Mint a 4.5, but am rounding up since I feel Yelpers have unfairly rated the place low in their first year of operation. I'll definitely be a repeat customer for The Mint again if the level of food quality and preparation holds up.
