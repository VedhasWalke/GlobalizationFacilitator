I ordered the $23 non-vegetarian Thali (a dal, two curries, two large pieces of naan, a big container of rice, a small container of rice pudding, and a buttermilk) on DoorDash and the total delivery was $28 (before tip). Portion sizes were large (lots of chicken in both curries) and it was two meals for me. Definitely get the Thali, because the variety of three curries is worth it!
