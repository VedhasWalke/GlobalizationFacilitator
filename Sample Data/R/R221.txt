Food quality is pretty good, some dishes were lackluster or small for the price, but they had a nice variety of seemingly authentic cuisine (would recommend the crunchy lotus, a delicious and unique dish).
Service was a little less good - felt like our table was ignored when we waited to order and we were never offered water refills.
COVID protocols were not good. When we requested a table, they literally placed a new table between two other tables in a tight alleyway, eliminating any semblence of social distancing. I get that restaurants like this one are in a tough position because they have so little outdoor space, but this was an insensitive move to all the customers already seated around us.  
Most upsetting to me was the multiple surprises on our bill. They seated us with bottled waters, which we assumed were COVID-related; without any mention, they charged us for the bottles! To make matters worse, they charged an automatic 20% tip on our bill, which they claimed "everyone is doing" in the COVID era. Pretty sure that's not a thing...
