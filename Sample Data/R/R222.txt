I'm giving this place a 4star only because i don't have the option to give it 3.5 stars. And not that i had a avg experience however we only ordered 2 items and thats not enough to give it a 4 or 5 star. That said, i would certainly consider eating in here if in the area.
We ordered grilled pomfret on a sizzler plate for appetizer and it was delicious. perfectly spiced but still retained the true flavors of the fish.
And for entree we ordered paneer bhurji (mashed cottage cheese in onion tomato semi-gravy) and that was mild and a little low on flavors but still good but the portion was huge and the garlic naan that we ordered to go with it was think and crisp as it should be. So overall the experience was good.
