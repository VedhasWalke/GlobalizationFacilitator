My vegetarian grill came out burned and had very little paneer. Mostly charred onions. My wife ordered the thali and when I told the waiter that the chicken was room temperature, he said "Oh that's because it was sitting under the light while waiting for your order".   and walked away. I spent $50 for two of the worst Indian dinners ever. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Over priced and poor quality.
