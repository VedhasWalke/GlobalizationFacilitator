We had dinner at Mint today and were pretty disappointed.
For appetizers, we had masala papad and mixed pakoras. Masala papad was okay except for surprise ingredient of Sev sprinkled on it. For the mixed pakoras, assortment didn't match the description on the menu. One potato and no paneer pakora. Onion ones had good seasoning but they were pretty doughy.
Two of us ordered Thalis. One of which showed up before the appetizers due to a mix up. Not a big deal if that was the only thing that went wrong. All curries in the thali, both veg and non-veg were cold and pretty much tasteless. Chicken seemed stale and lamb was chewy. Lentil items were pretty good and so was the raita. We had also ordered butter chicken and paneer makhni which were mediocre but better than curries that came with the Thali.
Masala soda I had ordered and awaited for till halfway through my meal tasted like purified water with some salt and paper sprinkled on it.
To top it all off, they added 20% tip to the bill without asking, even though we were party of four. We paid without fuss and got out of there.
