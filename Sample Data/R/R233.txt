Great and affordable lunch buffet! The a la carte options are also excellent. The interior is a bit small so might not be best for large groups, but the service is great and the food is fantastic. The downstairs section also offers a lunch box during the day that comes with naan, rice, an entree, daal, and a dessert -- all for a single-digit price. Highly recommend!
