I'll start this review by saying that I thought all of the food was very delicious. The butter chicken curry was good, as was the cauliflower and potato curry, but the chicken pot biryani dish was the best.
My primary complaint with this restaurant lies in its service. Granted, the restaurant was very busy when I went for Saturday dinner. Understandably, this is a busy time. The host had to move another party in order to accommodate my party of five.
It took a while to get water and napkins for the table, a bit longer to get 5 menus, and a bit of time before the waiter was ready to take our order after we had all decided what we wanted.
The food took a long time to come out by our standards, maybe 30-40 minutes, and the biryani came out later than the other dishes.
Overall, I would probably still recommend this restaurant but I would not come on a Saturday night. I would like to try the buffet where I know the food will be good and service will be less of an issue. I may recommend this restaurant on a less crowded night also.
Also, there were still Valentine's decorations inside in late February and what seemed to be Christmas lights outside. I wish those were gone!
Just one perspective.
