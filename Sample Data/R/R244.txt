Kochi was better once.
I wonder if there was any notion was that perhaps I couldn't handle a strong spice as the Chicken Lollipops and Gobi 65 were really rather uncharacteristically bland.  They were both fried well but were not seasoned well.  The Gobi 65 was particularly disappointing as they were smaller nibbles of cauliflower.  I'm not sure if anyone prefers fried food this way but I definitely like larger pieces.  A final dusting of salt before serving would have helped the flavor.  The accompanying dipping sauce was forgettable.
The Meen Pollichathu was small and really dry.  Having remembered having a well prepared dish here previously, I was certainly looking forward to it again but I couldn't get over thinking my fish was prepared once before and prepared a second time for me thereby making it dry.  This particular pomfret was also smaller, which meant there wasn't much meat to extract off the bones.
The gravy for the Shrimp Roast was very nice.  Good spice, nice heat, nice thin strips of onions that were sweated well.  The medium shrimp was ok.  The flavors in the gravy didn't penetrate the shrimp, which implied they were prepared separately and tossed in the gravy at the end.  Saucing the basmati rice with this gravy certainly enhanced the rice.
Giving Kochi the benefit of prior meals, I bumped up the rating just a tad to account for how I once remembered Kochi.  Hopefully they can return to their prior roots on my next visit.
