The food and service at Kochi is wonderful. If you want to really enjoy your meal, select the South Indian dishes on the menu - the meen curry, meen in banana leaf, dosas, appam with stew, etc. This food from Kerala is so authentic that it makes me nostalgic for the wonderful meals that I eat when I visit there. Treat yourself - eat at Kochi Indian Cuisine!
