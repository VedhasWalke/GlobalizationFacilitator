Wow this Indian restaurant blew my mind and taste buds! I was in the mood for something different and boy did I come to the right place!
Recommended to me by fellow yelper Tara M. I trusted this place would be top-notch... She was certainly right!  There isn't anything I ate that night that was not insanely delicious!  For dinner I had chicken Saagwala - loved the spicy, spinach-based sauce!   With some garlic naan bread I was in heaven for sure!
For dessert I had the beet root halwa which was also recommended by Tara.  Wow talk about something new, delicious and addicting!  I'll be back!
On top of everything the atmosphere and service could not have been better! Highly recommended!
