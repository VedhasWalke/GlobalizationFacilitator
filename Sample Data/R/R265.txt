I have been here multiple times. As a South Indian Woman who is from Kerala, where this cuisine is from, it is authentic af. Don't come here expecting tikka masalas (which is not even real indian food) or any north indian preparations (naan, dhal, etc). The harder the name is to pronounce, the better. Come for the aapums, shrimp, and whole baked fish. Especially the fish. Kerala is know for fish.
Also Indian lunch buffets are bad. Take it from an indian, don't go to them unless we recommend the place. Just an fyi from your friendly neighborhood indian.
