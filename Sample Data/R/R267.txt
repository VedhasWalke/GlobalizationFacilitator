Came here because for something different. We ve been here before but it had been awhile.
It's located in the small strip center that includes the Burlington Cost factory. It wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately. The room is somewhat dark given the dark furniture and dark paneling. But the food was bright.
We started with a Dosa and Veggie pakora. The Dosa is a type of pancake similar to s crepe that is filled with a potato mixture. It came with three different types of sauces including a lentil mixture and a spicy mixture.
The veggie pakora was breaded similar to a tempura with a mint dipping sauce. Both appetizers were excellent. We also ordered some garlic naan bread which was very good.
For our main meals we ordered  Chicken tikka Masala and Chicken majkahani. The waiter made sure to ask us about the amount of spiciness that we wanted for our meals.  Both came out as requested.   Both meals came with basmati rice. The portions didn't seem that big but they were very filling. Both main courses were excellent.
Next time we will opt for some dessert because we just didn't have any room.
If I have one complaint it's that the main courses came out very quickly as we finished the appetizers. Next time we go we will definitely mention to slow it down between courses.
