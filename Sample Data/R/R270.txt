Kochi NEVER fails to impress. This has become our GOTO place when it come to impressing guests and earn bragging rights.
As always the Crab ALWAYS steals the show so does the banana leaf wrapped fish (Disclaimer- fishy smell associated with not so fresh fish, but thats because of the choice of fish (trying to keep it authentic), but seriously they should look into using other local fishes). Recent love affair has been developed with the Shrimp appetizer.
