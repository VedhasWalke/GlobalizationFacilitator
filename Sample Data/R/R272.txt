If I could give them 10 stars I would. Not only the food was delicious but it was authentic Malyali. I travelled almost 50 miles from my place to have their food. My husband who is raised in Kerala was looking to eat Kappa Meen and I wanted Appam with Chicken Stew, but were not sure whether this place would meet our expectations. By far it exceeded all our expectations. Our server 'Basu' was very courteous and handled our order really well. This place is kid-friendly. I would definitely keep returning to Kochi Indian Cuisine and would highly recommend to my everyone who would love to have authentic Malabar experience.
PS: I left my phone hurriedly because I got busy packing an infant and toddler. When I went back to ask if I left it on my table Basu helped me retrieve it.
