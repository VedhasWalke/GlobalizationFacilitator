This place has one of the most authentic Kerala ( south Indian ) food you could find with in a 200 miles radius.
Do yourself a favor and don't order the typical north Indian food from here. *Chicken tikka masala is not an Indian dish* . Indian's don't eat that in India
Try Idiyappam, Kappa and meen curry, Fish in Banana leaf, Thali, Sadhya  ( if available ). Kerala porotta with Athirachi varutharachathu, Koyi varutharachathu and for beverage try soda naranga vellam.
Trust me you would love it. Try something different.
