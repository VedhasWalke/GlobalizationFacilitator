A great place for Indian Mallu food. Ours was a quick lunch,  food was great , meen polichadhu,  adipoli felt needed little more salt, or perfect. Parotta aatuirachi and kozhi vartharachadhu,  tasted good. Will recommend to try and keep coming.
Good luck Mathew and his friend running this business.
