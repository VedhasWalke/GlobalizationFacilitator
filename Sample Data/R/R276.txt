Captain got upset coz we asked for change ,!due some 9 bucks, he asked do I need change ?
When said yes, he got upset and didn't show any courtesy towards us when we were leaving.. even though I left 5 bucks ... no good night no door opening rather giving us a stare.. that left a bad taste even though food was very tasty...
