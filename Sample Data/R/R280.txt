Great service and tasty food!
We ordered Chemmeen (shrimp stir fry) and Chicken biryani. Shrimp appetizer was mild spicy and tasty. But the biryani was too oily. They prepared the biryani again and served us. This time it was fine. They also complemented us with beetroot halwa dessert. Before we leave chef came to say sorry about the biryani. Definitely great service.
