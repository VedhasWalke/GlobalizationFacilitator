Just like momma used to make, or you wish she did. (Sorry mom...)
Quick disclaimer, I actually know both Thomas & Matthew but as you can see from the other reviews, that doesn't cloud this review in the least.
Yes, they do Kerala style (Malayalee) food well, but they seem to do all the regional Indian cuisines well. I briefly stopped by during their grand opening and had the good fortune to try out a number of dishes and I'm happy to see that they're still churning out top quality food from the kitchen.
On my last visit, we started off with the chicken lollypops, the Indian version of buffalo wings. They were very tasty, but like buffalo wings, would've been perfect with beer so I'll make sure to come prepared next time. (It's byob!)
On to the main event. As others have stated, the baked fish in a banana leaf is a showstopper and delicious. (Meen Pollichathu). You've got to order this.
The dal makhani (mixed lentil curry) was the best dal I've ever had and our leftovers made for a great lunch the next day over some white rice.  At the restaurant, we scooped the makhani up with a buttery flaky paratha which was perfect for it.
For our "meat dish" we opted for the mutton curry with coconut and spices (attirachi varuthachthu). The meat was tender and the curry packed a complex blend of spices which was not too hot. (Matt told us that he relies on black pepper over chili powder because the latter is usually the cause of upset stomachs - useful tip for our own home cooking.)
Now, I'm not a big beet fan, nor would I have ever put it anywhere near a dessert list but don't miss their beet root halwa for dessert. It's slowly simmered in milk for hours and is velvety soft and not overly sweet.
I only wish this place was closer to me so I could be a regular.
