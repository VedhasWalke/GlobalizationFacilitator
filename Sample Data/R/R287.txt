Excellent food,  ambience & service. We had Malabar paratha,  lobster malabar curry , shrimp biriyani. Lobster was so delicious & lip smacking malabar paratha. Lobster curry is more than enough for two people. Shrimp biriyani also is also more than enough for two people & equally aromatic & delicious.
Definitely recommend for die hard foodies.
