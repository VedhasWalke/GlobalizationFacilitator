Very good food but very expensive for the size of the appetizers and entrees! My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer of samosas with 2 entrees of chicken tikka masala and some garlic naan and it cost $40!! Maybe it's just me but that seems expensive for the amount/portions of the food. The taste and quality were very good though.
