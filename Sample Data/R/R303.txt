We really enjoyed our dinner at Kochi. We had appam with egg masala, chicken saag, okra curry and a layered bread. The food is in the style of Kerala. It was fragrant and exciting to look at. The spices (medium) were perfect. The dessert we ordered, a beet burfi (not on menu), was served with an orchid. This would make a terrific Valentine's Day dinner, especially the beet dessert. It is tucked into a strip mall where a so-so Thai restaurant used to be. They also seemed to be doing a brisk take-out business. This food is very special. We sat, supped, and relaxed.
