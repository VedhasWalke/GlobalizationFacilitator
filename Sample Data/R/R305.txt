I read the great reviews on Yelp, so because I was in the area my family and I decided to give it a try. First and foremost, the service and hospitality are SUPERB! They take their time in explaining everything and are very insightful about the distinctiveness of their menu offering. This is an authentic, fresh, well spiced, and delicious dining experience. I am a fan of Indian cuisine and this is by far one of the best meals that I have ever had. I was eating with my wife and 11 year old son who were both experiencing authentic home made Indian food for the very first time. We ordered the Garlic Naan bread, Lollipop Chicken, Spicy Shrimp, Vegetable Somosa, Whole Fish cooked in a banana leaf, Open range chicken, Coconut Curry Chicken, and Homemade ice cream ... Everything was AMAZING & DELICIOUS!!
We live about 90 minutes from this restaurant, but we will definitely make plans to visit this authentic and tasty dining experience at least once a month. I really appreciated the owner taking the time to make sure that my family and I enjoyed every aspect of our meal. The Chef even came out to greet us at our table and asked for feedback on whether or not the level of spicing was on point for us. A well played move that inspired me to write this review. I  am already looking forward to my next visit to KOCHI.
KOCHI should stand for a KNOWLEDGE OF COOKING & HOSPITALITY from INDIA!!
