We had the pleasure of checking out this restaurant with my family over the weekend.
Very good, authentic Indian food. I prefer their South Indian food, and that's their specialty, but they do a good job with the North Indian mix also.
Food: The appetizers were very good and presented beautifully. Chicken lollipops are crisp and easy to eat. The main courses were top notch. My brother loved the chicken tikka masala, my folks favored the meen (fish curry - forgot the full name), and my wife and I loved the lamb rogan josh. Meats were tender, curries were delicious and the food was not too spicy (in fact, I might ask for it a bit spicier next time).
Definitely try their Kerala parotta and poori - fluffy and delicious. Their garlic nan was ok - perhaps a tad overdone. We're excited to go back and try their Malabar items and  thalis. I think this was a soft opening so not all the menu items were available at the time.
Presentation of the food was awesome. Found myself taking pictures quite often :) Quantity of the food was appropriate (we ordered 2 appetizers, and 3 main courses, with 3 or 4 breads for the family of 5 of us).
Service  was excellent. Appropriate attire, and great response to customer needs.
Would go back again.
