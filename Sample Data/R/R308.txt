We were on our way back from Maryland to Nj and wanted to try out Indian cuisine for lunch. Found this restaurant from yelp and thought we would try this out. We tried the crispy Gobi 65, seafood soup, kappa meen curry ( Tapioca and fish curry), masala dosa etc. i love spicy food and felt it was just awesome!!! Great service too..
For folks who like authentic South Indian (keralite or chettinad) spicy cuisine, I would highly recommend this place.
