Usually I don't write reviews but this was the worst experience ever. Being a Indian this was the most awful food ever. The place is trying to fancy Indian restaurant but it not even close to being one. For the price they charge I will not recommend to anyone. I have no idea why they have 4 star.  Food smelled it has gone bad. Beyond service was damn freaking worst. Appetizer came after dinner. They brought sabzi and give naan after rice. Piece of garbage don't waste money.
For some reason I had to give them 1 star as 0 was not available.
