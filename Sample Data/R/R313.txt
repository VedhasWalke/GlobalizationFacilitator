The waiter was not at all attentive towards us and moved towards a different group in the middle of our order. The food is very overpriced and quantity is little. They used the same curry sauce in all the dishes and appetizers. There are not many Vegetarian options and the ones we ordered are not at all good. The chicken and shrimp biryani we ordered was made with the least  amount of care. Iwould suggest to pick another restaurant if you would like to try authentic Indian food. I wouldn't come here again.
