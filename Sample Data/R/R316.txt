This is what I would call a wholesome experience! Excellent food, a conversation with the chef and owner and also a bday celebration . This truly is an awesome place to have some Kerala food . To give 5 stars means a lot and this place deserves it . The food was freshly made, tasted authentic(which means spicy!) and was a delight to eat . The fish curry was great but the stand out was the mutton (boneless mutton). The kalappams and and the Malabar paranthas were perfectly done and complimented the entrees. This is a gem that I found all thanks to Yelp . Will be making many more trips to this place now!
