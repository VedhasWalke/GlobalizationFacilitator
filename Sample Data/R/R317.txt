This is a wonderful Indian restaurant with much of the food based on the style of cooking from Kerala.  Mathew, the chef prepared the food with great care! All fresh spices and good quality fish and poultry dishes.   The the waiter and staff were very attentive and helpful as well.   The chef, who is also the owner, came out and explained the dishes and helped us with our selection.   The environment was cozy and friendly.   All in all a great dining experience!
