I consider myself to be pretty adventurous when it comes to trying different cuisines.  Although my experience with Indian food is VERY limited, when my sister and her husband suggesting coming here, I was looking forward to exploring a cuisine that I'm not too familiar with.
Upon arriving, you can't help but notice it is in a strip mall, which may turn off some people.  But c'mon people- this is Jersey- everything is in a strip mall!  The inside décor was simple but nice.  We visited for a late lunch on a Sunday and were the only guests.
We ordered a couple orders of vegetable samosas to start.  These were massive!  Now I'm not too familiar with samosas but after eating one here, I am hooked!  For my entrée, I got a curry chicken dish.  It was delicious.  Others at my table got the chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer.  We also got some garlic naan which was incredidbly garlicky--- vampires beware!
As a noob to Indian food, I really enjoyed my meal and it is inspiring me to eat more Indian food in the very near future!
