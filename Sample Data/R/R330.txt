I find the food to be mediocre at best. I ordered the crab and found the inside to be cold while it was drizzled with sauce on top. The crab meat frankly tasted "dated", not fresh. The chicken dish is ok, similar to other places while the seafood soup was pretty terrible. Perhaps it was my mistake to order seafood at an Indian restaurant, was disappointing nevertheless. Very friendly service but not likely to return
