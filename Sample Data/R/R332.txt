I've eaten Indian food on three continents. Kochi is easily competitive with the best I've had anywhere else. The place specializes in food from the Malabar coast, unlike the vast majority of Indian restaurants in the US. They put great care into the creation of their sauces, as you can tell when you discover the subtle differences between the seasonings used for each dish. The chef takes obvious & much deserved pride in his creations & is very friendly & forthcoming, explaining what the dishes are & asking for feedback from his customers. This place is both an eye opener & a real feast for the senses. Just go.
