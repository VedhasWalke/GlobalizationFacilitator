Outside of India or London, central Jersey is probably the best place to get Indian food just because of the high number of Indo-Americans who live in the area. So it's a pretty competitive market, and this new arrival is competitive. It took us a while to try Kochi after the old restaurant at this location went out of business. Now I wish we'd checked out Kochi sooner.
My wife, a vegan, found plenty of good choices (not something we can usually count on when we eat out). We started with the vegie samosas and vegie pekora. Then she had the vegie rice biryani and jafrezi (sp?) while I had chicken tikka masal and garlic naan. The food here seems to feature more of the north Indian fare, but it's got all the usual dishes you expect to find on a solid Indian menu. Some hidden surprises were on the dessert menu. I tend to think of Indian deserts as limited and goopy, but there was a fantastic homemade cinnamon ice cream and a complex layered pastry that we not over sweet but subtle and a perfect way to end the meal.
Here's what set the food apart from other local Indian places: nothing was oily or heavy, we got to choose our spice levels and they were consistent, the portion sizes were substantial but not overload. The prices were about the same as other Indian in the area . We'll definitely head back for the buffet, which is a steal. But the best aspect of the experience was the customer service which was not intrusive but very attentive.
