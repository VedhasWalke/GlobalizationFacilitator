We had lunch here to celebrate my dad's birthday. There were 5 of us in our group and we were among the first ones to show up for lunch.
It was freezing outside so we decided to start off with a spicy Tomato Rasam and the Kochi seafood soup.
Rasam (a highly seasoned hot and sour Indian soup similar to Tom Yum) is the quintessential hug in a bowl during winter months and is also a good indicator of how good the rest of the food will be. Every one can make Rasam but making a really good bowl with the perfect balance of hot and sour is hard. We must say that we had one of the best ones at this place.
We ordered the gobi 65, veggie pakora and chicken lollipop for appetizers. These three were pretty decent but we've had better versions of these dishes at other Indian restaurants. Hence, we decided to stick to malabar specialties for the main course.
We ordered the appam (a fermented rice batter and coconut milk crepe), idiyappam (rice noodles) and an eggplant kozhambu (a stew similar to sambar).
A quick language tid bit. Anything with a (zh) is pronounced like an L with the tongue rolled back in Malayalam. There's no equivalent syllable in English but a sharp L is as close as it gets.
For the non vegetarian selections, we picked the kurumulagu kozhi and malabar fish curry. We chose to order more appams (served individually) to accompany the two kerala style gravies. We were right on the money again.
Our final verdict is that the Malabar selections at this place are excellent and highly recommended but the restaurant is a bit expensive compared to other Indian places in the tri state area.
