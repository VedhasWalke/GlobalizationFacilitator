I've been to Kochi a few times and this place doesn't disappoint.  Kochi specializes in cuisine from the state of Kerala(they also have dosas and some North Indian dishes as well).  The food here is flavorful and fresh.  I've tried the vegetarian biriyani, idiappam, and appam and all three were delicious!
I brought someone who hails from Kerala to this restaurant.  According to him, this place is certified authentic and a true taste of home.
Kochi is a departure from standard Indian restaurant fare and I definitely recommend it.
