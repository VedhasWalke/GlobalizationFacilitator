Sumptuous real indian food. Tandoori chicken was very tender and juicy. One of the desserts had small portion, but taste was bliss - it was made of wheat and jaggery. Kerela goat dish (I don't remember the name) was very balanced in flavor - spices were not overpowering.
However, mutton biryani could have been better. Mutton was not as tender as I expect them to be. In biryani mutton meat should fall off from bones. Also biryani rice was not very flavorful - coming from Lucknow, I have high bar for biryani.
Service is excellent: Once when they were taking time in cooking my order, they gave me a free appetizer.
