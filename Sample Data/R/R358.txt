Was searching Yelp for a new restaurant around town and came across Kochi, which turns out has been open for about 3 weeks now.  Called to make a take out order, was told it would be ready in 25 minutes.  When getting to the place 30 minutes later to pick up the food, had to wait an additional 20 minutes along with asking numerous times if the food was ready.  Felt like they didn't start making the order until I got to the restaurant.  The place is somewhat clean, the floors were dirty but the restaurant was busy.  They restaurant staff seemed unorganized...
When we finally got the food, paid, and were leaving, we just happened to pick up the to go menu...turns out they had a new customer coupon for 10% off  they could have easily offered to us while we waited since the food was not exactly cheap-two appetizers, two entrees and naan was $52.  The website has no $ listing on its menu.
The food was decent, which I would give a 3 star however the service was terrible.
