Kochi is great!
A perfect intertwinement of authentic Indian food and great service. I have been here multiple times, and have always left with a smile on my face and a full stomach. I especially recommend the chicken with coconut dish, mango lassis, the masala crab and the naan bread.
Additionally, the owner Thomas is extremely charismatic and makes an effort to welcome everyone and make sure that their experience at Kochi is optimal. Chef Matthew is amazing too, he was trained at Taj Kochi, so his food is a real treat.
