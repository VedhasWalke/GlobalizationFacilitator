We have been to this place twice. Once it was awesome (this was about a year ago) and recently it was just ok. This recent time, the dosa seemed greasy, the raita seemed like they had just thrown it together, and the chiken tikka appetizer was a little dry and underwhelming. The Naan was good. They did not have poori or mango chutney. The place is near my mother in law's house, and it's an option when you are nearby. Maybe we were there on an off night, but it was just ok.
