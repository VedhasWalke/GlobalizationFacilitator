Awesome food, everytime I have eaten here has been a great experience. If you are a fan of Indian Kerala food, this is the best option in New Jersey. Try the Kappa meen curry, appam egg curry, fish biryani, all quality cuisines. Its a 40 min drive from my place but that does not stop me from visiting atleast once a month!
