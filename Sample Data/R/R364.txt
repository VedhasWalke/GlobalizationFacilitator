I moved to NJ like a month ago, but I've already been to kochi restaurant 3 times and it's 35 min drive from my apartment.so that's saying something.food is amazing, the people are nice, especially the guy. The first time there were 4 of us, and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. Kappa and meen curry was delicious, so was appam.  The Star dish however is attirachi ularthiyath. It's spicy , cooked to perfection and mind blowing!  I wasn't a big fan of fish biriyani but everyone else in the group loved it. Puttu could have been better. We had a great time that day , spent with friends. And thank you for the complimentary beetroot halwa. we will b back.
