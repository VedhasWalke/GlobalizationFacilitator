Had a low expectation going into the store, but quite happy as we came out. Excellent food and service. We went there for lunch. The place was packed since it was Father's Day. Wait time was appropriate. Decor was excellent. The food was very flavorful. Some of the highlight food we had were chemeen ullathiyathu (shrimp fry) and meen pollicharhu (fish fry). The sea food soup is another must to try out. So overall the place was just wonderful!
