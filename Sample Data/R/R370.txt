I've seen this place change owners and it is still good. The spices are on point, the naan is hot and fresh, and there is lots of gravy for dipping.  The portion size could be a bit bigger for the price. Also, BRING BACK THE DARN LUNCH BUFFET!! I go to Roti's in the Shoprite plaza now because I need lunch buffets in my life (and they always give me extra naan :)
