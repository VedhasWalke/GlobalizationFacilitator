I am so happy that I found Kochi. I have been craving Indian food and I have never been able to find a place that would modify a dish to the way I want it and do it so readily.
The staff is very knowledgeable, pleasant and very courteous.  I stopped in and ordered another modified dish as a take out. While I waited for my order, I was given an appetizer to enjoy while I waited...at no extra charge.
I will return weekly...the food is so good!
