This is a hidden gem so close to us! The nondescript location, the banal facade, and the lack of advertising lend the impression of a generic Indian restaurant, which is what we thought till we tried the sumptuous regional cuisine. So, go and give it a try and stick to the Kerala cuisine, and you will walk out content!
We were here for my Dad's birthday and given his penchant for fish with some spice, we decided to try the baked fish, shrimp curry, and the fish curry - all of which were all very nicely done with a good variation of spices. (Ask for the "mild" version if your palate is low on spice tolerance). The dessert of beet root halwa and rice grain batter was delicious.
The service was attentive and pleasant, accommodating the requests of 4 kids in tow. Looking forward to our next dining trip to Kochi :)
