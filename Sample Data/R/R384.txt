This is a restaurant that serves authentic cuisine of the state of Kerala in India. I have been to many Indian restaurants around NJ and NY and I think this place is unique and is a gastronomical delight. Should try the meen pollichathu (Fish wrapped in a leaf) for sure. The new Chef who moved from California has brought in a lot of new additions and added his own twist to many of the dishes. I recommend this place to all those who love Indian food and would like to try something unique and different from what you get in Edison, NJ.
