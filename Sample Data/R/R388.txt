Kochi "The Queen of Arabian Sea"???
Nooo.. This Kochi is different, "Kochi Indian Cuisine"... Different in all good ways with awesome food and amazing hospitality.
Had Kappa & Meen Curry.. Wooooow!!!
I wish I had an extra compartment in my stomach to store more ;)
They made our day very SPECIAL, with a finishing touch of "Kerala Halwa".
Definitely will go back when we pass by..
