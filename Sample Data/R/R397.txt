I'm no stranger to Indian cuisine and I hate to say, this place just didn't do it for me. The Vegetarian Jalfrezi was bland and the Chicken Tikka was flavorless as well. I did enjoy the Garlic Naan, but that's about it. The presentation and service was very nice, but based on the quality of the food, I will not be returning. Hopefully the chef just had an off night because this town definitely needs some diversity in the food it has to offer.
