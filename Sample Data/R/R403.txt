First time here today. We were all pleasantly blown away. The food is exceptional. We are from Kerala and it has to be said this was possibly the best Kerala Cuisine we have had in a long while. The appams were perfect (I think we ended up ordering 10). The fish was good but the Malabar Porotta and the goat (aatirachi) were truly magnificent. Even the desserts (not usually the strongest menu items in a typical Kerala spread) were outstanding. Service was good and we are going back tomorrow for Sunday lunch!
