I have always looked for an authentic Kerala restaurant in the area and now I think we have it. Kochi is it and I hope it stays that way. The chef and co owner Mathew is as authentic as you can get out here. They constantly try dishes off the beaten path and they are as authentic as you can get away from home. Today we came back blown away with the special Onam dinner served on banana leaves. This is a new place so be patient with the service the guys at times are overwhelmed but the food is well worth the wait. Go try it, you will like it.
