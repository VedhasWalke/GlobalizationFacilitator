Overall, ths was a great experience. The prices are good, serving size is perfect, ambience was authentic and the service was wonderful. We started with the Gobi 65 and had paneer tikka massala and vegetarian jal frazi and the were both delicious. The garlic naan we had with the meal was very flavorful as well.
