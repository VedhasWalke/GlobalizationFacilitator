Absolutely amazing food ... they have a small menu and they serve all the dishes fresh. They take a while to get the food out, that is because they make everything from scratch.  The Fish Fry (Meen Pollichathu )is must eat , absolutely amazing. This Fish fry has an authentic Kerala taste , frankly never eaten else where. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. My wife was eating pottu and she wanted a Banana as a side with it, as it usually eaten like that back home, the host actually took the effort to go to the grocery store and get one .. That was impressing.
If you love kerela food this is a must go.
Do not forgot ask what there specials are , there a lot of stuff that they prepare that are not on the menu.
