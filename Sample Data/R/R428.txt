Awesome food, had to wait a little bit & service was little bit on a slower side on a Saturday evening but it was all worth.... despite of huge rush staff was courteous & dishes seemed  authentically prepared & delicious.... portions were slightly smaller as compared to what I am used to in an Indian restaurant in states...
