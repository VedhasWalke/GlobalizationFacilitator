Went here for Valentine's Day and had no problem getting a table. Brought a nice bottle of Pinot Noir to compliment the spice of the food. Started with the Paneer tikka which is now my new favorite Indian dish, I could of had three plates of just that. The cheese was soft on the inside while being slightly crunchy on the outside which made for a great texture clash. It's definitely a must if you come here. For my entree I ordered the kurumulagu kozhi (black pepper chicken). This dish was one of the spiciest dishes I've ever had, and I've traveled to Thailand. That being said it was also one of the best dishes I've had in some time. Definitely not for those who can't handle heat. For dessert we had the gulab jamun which in my opinion is a must after any Indian dinner! They were soft and sweet like they should be. Service was great. I would just say that if you go to be ready for spicy since this is South Indian Kerala cuisine. Would recommend to everyone!
