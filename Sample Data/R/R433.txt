The food here is excellent. Definitely try the Kerala Parotta and Mutton dish from the appetizer menu (Its the dry one not a gravy). Also the malabar fish curry.
Wish the service was a bit faster but the owner always comes to the table to explain that the food is made fresh and hence takes a bit of time to come out.
We've been to the place 4 times and the quality has remained the same.
