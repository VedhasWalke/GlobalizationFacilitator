I don't remember the exact name of the dish. However I surely remember the food tasted very good. We has Fish curry and it was coconut based Kerala style. It was very authentic and spicy. This one of the first Indian restaurant in a long time where the food tasted like real Indian food without any cream and added almond sauce.
We loved it. My son loved his Dosai too.
We will go back to that place which close by.
