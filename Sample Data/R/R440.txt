Food, service and atmosphere are all outstanding!  I would recommend this place to all my friends...there is nothing better in the state of NJ!  I personally recommend the Kochi Chicken Curry or Tandoori Chicken served with the best Garlic Naan I have ever tasted!    Everything about this place has been above and beyond my expectations, I recommend taking a special trip to East Windsor just to visit Kochi Indian Cuisine.
