I had a craving for Indian food and this place definitely hit the spot. Aside from the food, what stood out was the service. When we first arrived, as we looked at our menus, the manager/ owner came by and thoroughly explained the cuisine and answered any questions we had. Two people in my group had the spicy seafood soup. This tomato-based soup was nice and hearty. We ordered the butter chicken (off menu), kochi chicken curry special, and a spicy shrimp dish. The butter chicken was tomato based and the kochi chicken curry had coconut in it, so while they were both curry dishes, they balanced each other out. The shrimp dish was super spicy ...but just the way my friend liked it. We ate family style with sides of rice and garlic naan, which I highly recommend. I'm definitely coming back here again. They also have lunch buffet during the weekdays so if you're not sure what to order, this is a great way to sample everything.
