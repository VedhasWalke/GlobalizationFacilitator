The event was my 35th wedding anniversary.  We ordered a variety of dishes, starting with a vegetable pakora.  Our entrees were all delicious, served beautifully and piping hot.  Spice level was perfect (just tell them what you like.)  The garlic naan was superb.  After dinner three darling little girls presented us with a beet pudding with an orchid in it and a candle, and wished us a happy anniversary!  It was lovely.  The service was extremely attentive.
