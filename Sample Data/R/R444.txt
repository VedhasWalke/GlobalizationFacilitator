3 of us went for buffet lunch on friday afternoon last week to Kochi. The buffet bar was almost empty. It took staff close to 40 minutes to refill few dishes. By this time our lunch break was over. Staff told us that they were very busy and they ran out of dishes. Clearly this restaurant lacks in customer service.
