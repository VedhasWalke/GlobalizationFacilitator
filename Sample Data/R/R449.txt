I had high hopes for this place especially because the prices for the dishes was so high. I ordered one dish and was expecting to be virtually transported to Kerala and its backwaters.. Instead, fortunately or unfortunately, I remained grounded in NJ! The price of the dish was $16 and I was hoping it is at least better than what I  get in  standard restaurant for much less. Admittedly, I came into the restaurant just when it opened (5:00 PM), but that seems no reason for subpar food. I will give it one more chance, and if it as bad as last time, well it is bye-bye!
