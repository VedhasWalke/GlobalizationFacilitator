Kochi is a treasure and I'm glad it's in my neck of the woods. It's very hard to find good Malayali cuisine (not Keralan, ever) in this country. And to find this place that serves meen (fish) curry, chemmeen ularthiyathu, idiyappam, Attirachi (goat) varutharachchtu... what can I say, I was thrilled. the Varutharachchtu has real slivers of roasted coconut, the prawns (chemmeen) are flavoured with the spices that Kerala is famous for. The service was relaxed and the food, fresh and delicious. It was a great way to introduce friends to a cuisine that was new for them. The stew was delicately fragrant and the Kerala halwa (black halwa) took me back to my days in college. Ordering tikka masala here would be like ordering meatloaf at an Italian restaurant. Naah, let your tastebuds feel the true sensations of Kerala's unique blend of fragrances, light sauces and walk away from the table feeling replete, not heavy with those yellow-orange-red oily creamy mystery one-note dishes that signify Indian food in Indian restaurants in America. Move away from tikka masala and rogan josh; dive into attirachi curry, appam-stew, and puttu kadala (chick peas over steamed fluffy rice "cakes"), and that divine eggplant kozhambu. Coconut milk, coconut milk, all give this food it's unique taste, mild, yet rich. Those fine rice noodles, light and airy to soak that sauce. Bring a couple of beers or wine to accompany the goat and shrimp appetizers. And when you leave, you'll be wanting to come right back. The next day. Bon appetit!
