Kochi  is truly wonderful place  if you are craving true south Indian dishes.   We started our meal with appetizers - Samosas(veg) and Kochi  Stir Fried chicken, both were very good. Then,  for the main course we had several  dishes, including  Meen Pollichathu (spicy fish wrapped and baked in a banana leaf) the fish was moist and delicious,  chicken Tikka  Masala ( yeah I know it's not "south" Indian), Shrimp Malagu curry  and the Malabar Paratha.  The Paratha  and the curries came together  very nicely.  we also had their mango Lassi.  My kids had 2 each.   I haven't had such a delicious meal in a long time.  I was stuffed by the time I left.   Next time,  we will hit the Masala Dosas.  Well done Kochi...  thank you.
