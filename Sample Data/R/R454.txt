One of my friend told me about this restaurant. I took few of my friends to try the food. The lunch buffet is reasonably good with a combination of south and North Indian food. Though I did not find too many South Indian options whatever they had have a home cooked taste. The service staff is always there to assist.  For $9.95 we had a nice lunch buffet.
