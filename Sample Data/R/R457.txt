This restaurant is phenomenal. There's no shortage of Indian restaurants in the Mercer county area, but in my opinion Kochi is the best. My husband and I went for the weekday lunch buffet, which is well priced at just under 10 a person. We found a great mix of regional cuisine. Kochi competently executes the northern Indian / Mughal cuisine that dominates around here, but also provides more unusual offerings from the "spice coast" of India. We enjoyed the complimentary dosa that arrived with our naan (which was excellent, airy and delicious) and the fabulous thick texture of the raita. The samosas were flavorful and not the least bit greasy. I sampled the chicken curry, saag paneer, and several other dishes I can't recall and all were very good. My only suggestion would be a little more spice/heat, but that is a personal preference. Bonus: the decor is very clean and modern. The service was also superior, and the owner spoke to us and was very nice and informative. East windsor is a solid 30 minute drive for us, and other Indian joints are closer, but we will be coming back to this one.
