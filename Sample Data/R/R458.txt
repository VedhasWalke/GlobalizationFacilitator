Ordered out through grub hub.  Deliver was quick.  I have to say i have always enjoyed going here and getting dosas but having it delivered just wasn't the same.  I've been here a few times in the past and sat inside pre pandemic and the food was Umazinging but ordering out and having it delivered just was a different experience overall and personally i found it a bit soggy and just not the same experience.  I still give it a 4star because it's not the restaurants fault for the pandemic and i will definitely be retuning when everything opens back up.
