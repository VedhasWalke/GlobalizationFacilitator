Although, this place had been around for a while it was our first time here. We weren't expecting much given the mixed reviews.
We were craving Dosas and Saravana Bhavan had plenty to offer on their menu. We ordered a Masala Dosa and a Rava Onion Masala Dosa. These were some of the best dosas we've had. Perfectly made, fresh, crispy and the accompanying Sambar and chutneys were perfect. It far exceeded our expectations. Even my Indian mother couldn't stop raving on how good her Rava Onion Masala Dosa was.
They have outdoor seating on the side patio and in front of the restaurant. Indoor limited seating is also available.
