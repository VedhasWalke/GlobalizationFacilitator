Reached here on a Saturday at around 7.30pm - just in tie because right after us, several families entered and there was a long queue. They don't take reservations.
The service was good and super quick!
I've eaten at Saravana Bhavan in New York and the food at this one didn't match up to the NY one. Overall, I was quite disappointed.
Loved the madras coffee but other than that, the food was disappointing.
