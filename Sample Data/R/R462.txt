Had Mysore Masala Dosa this evening which ,I would say , was served hardly warm. No crispy and freshness in the dosa.  The dosa came within 5-7 min of ordering the food. Doubt they served someone else's order which was there in the kitchen. The server never brought the cutlery even after letting him know when he served the food. Once the food was over we were provided with cutlery. Over all very poor experience.
