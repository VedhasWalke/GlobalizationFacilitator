I look forward for Sarvana Bhavan for their authentic south indian style food and a defined taste and methods of following a recipe. This particular Saravan Bhavan doesn't stay up to the standards of the chain, with the experience of visiting this restaurant couple of times. Today I have ordered a Parotta, and it was very lazily cooked without layers and very evident that cook didnt put any effort, thick , over burnt and under cooked inside. I have made an effort in trying to explain my experience and how actually Parotta should be very generously, and I get back an expression of no care and there were no questions to ask in detail on what I didnt like. clearly they didnt bother.
