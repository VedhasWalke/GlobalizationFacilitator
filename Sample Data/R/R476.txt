Disappointed with some of the items we ordered. The waiting staff seemed disinterested and the service was generally not up to the mark.
Here is how I would rate the food we ordered:
Mango Lassi - 2/5
Special Thali - 3/5 tasted good although the portions do not justify the price.
Pav Bhaji - 1/5 the lousiest I have had so far
Mini Idli - 2/5 average fare
Don't think I will repeat this joint.
