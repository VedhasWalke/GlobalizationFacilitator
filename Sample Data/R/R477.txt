This is the WORST place to go. I do not have any word to compare with. I have ordered veg thali last friday and i got 2 empty bowls in it. When i called to ask if it was done by mistake... The lady was very rude and she doesnt have a minumum common sense on how to speak to a customer.
She did not understand what i am
asking for and started screaming instead. When i asked why are you screaming , she replied saying What do you want now? refund or one more thali for free.... she sounded very rude... on top of that she says most of the customers who complains are just to get some free food....
How can she just say that to a customer ? .. when i asked for the manager , she said i am the manager. I couldnt any more time speaking to her as its waste talking to such people!!!!
It was waste of time and gas to commute to the place!!!!
Worst place on earth
