Assuming that you know what you're ordering and you're familiar with south Indian food, the food here will likely meet your expectations. If not, please read. Like most places offering this kind of vegetarian food, most of the items here are super spicy so forget about your kids - even you're going need an ice bath for your tongue if you're not used to it. What's sad is that the heat kills the otherwise good food they make.  There's no option to request a spice level since most of the chutney, sambhar and curries are pre made.
In addition to the heat the spices can be completely off putting as well. I usually go with a dosa, a south Indian staple, but ordered porattas (parantha bread) and one of the accompaniments was a cauliflower curry. It was more like a soup with traces of cauliflower boiled to a mush in almost inedible eye watering spicy gravy. To make things worse there was way too much cardamom and other spices overpowering the poor cauliflower residue crying for help! The worst part - the bread was very good and I could have really enjoyed it... I tried dipping into the chutney choices my wife's dosa came with that she was struggling with and they were all off the chart for heat as well. I hope they read these reviews and choose to offer customers heat options.
