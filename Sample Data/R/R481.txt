This place has a really comforting atmosphere and the music that was playing was nice and not too loud. The food was also really flavorful. It tastes like authentic Indian food and it isn't too spicy. Some of the side curries can be spicy but just eat the curd (which is the white yogurt-like stuff) because it helps to sooth your tongue. We got the saravana special meal which came with curd and sweet among other sides. The pickle was the spiciest side but they are expected to be. If you're wary of spiciness, just try a small bit of everything before you take a spoon full. You should also mix the side curries with the rice. Overall, I was really happy with all the food that we got and will definitely go back again.
