There is no better brand of quintessential South Indian Vegetarian food. If anyone can lay claim to serving consistently authentic idli, vada, dosa with their chutney and sambhar, it is this place.
The service can vary by location. A trip here is like a trip to Madras, so the service is expected to be anything but just utilitarian.
You can try the North Indian items and they might not taste bad, but that'd be like going to Scotland for trying their tea.
