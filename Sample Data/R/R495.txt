I think the saravana bhavan in Edison is better, but this trumps the one in NY in my opinion plus it's 5 minutes away from our house. That said I come here all the time.
My family is from Chennai and we have watched the quality of saravana bhavan in India slowly decline over the years (it's a chain there). The good news is the ones in NJ are pretty good and comparable to what you used to get in India (or maybe it just seems better because there is not as much good Indian food here).
When I come here I always get the madras coffee, as its one of the only places I can get real filter coffee here. The chai here is also good.
My go to meals are the thali, onion rava dosa, kitchadi, ghee pongal,  Chana bhatura, poori, and mini idli.
