My exploration of Indian joints in the West Windsor/Plainsboro area continues.  This mostly occurs once a year when I'm home at my parents for Thanksgiving and looking for food with high school friends Thanksgiving day.  What we've learned is that only Indian and Chinese places are open Thanksgiving day.  
So this year we checked out Crown of India.  Overall it's okay, but I probably won't be back.  Palace of Asia in Lawrenceville still take the top spot in the area for me.  So back to Crown of India.  The buffet is good, but nothing special.  Some of the dishes felt a bit stale.  Especially the fried foods which were no longer crunchy and instead a bit soggy.
