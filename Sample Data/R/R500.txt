All stars are for food..sometime, I can ignore the average services for great food. Always open on time.. been here 3 times at 11 am Sunday mornings and most food items are available.  Ok, for the owners, please focus a little bit on the presentation aspects such as training receptionist to warmly welcome guests, using better than plastic glasses and carafes, etc. This could easily be one of the most successful chains for south Indian food if polished well and on time. Tip for first timer visitors: if your waist size is less than 42 inches, prefer to sit on the chairs instead of the sofa booths OR as for a ladle instead a spoon
