Been wanting to try this place after reading about it in the NY Times. I heard about this chain in NY and was happy that there was one right here in NJ, especially when their specialty is dosa! I ordered the Mysore Masala Dosa, which came out pretty quick. It was pretty good. Hubs had the Parotta and liked it. A nice addition to the area. Service was friendly and quick. Will definitely return when in the area!
