We've also been to another location of this chain on a trip to Abu Dhabi, and we were surprised to find out that they had one so close to home too. This place was every bit as good as the one there. Dosas and vadas came out crispy and the chutneys were delicious. What more can you say--they make things right and they don't dumb down the flavors for non-Indians.
So far, this place far exceeded my expectations. From the looks of things here on Yelp, they could be rather inconsistent. If it matters at all, we went on a Friday night. We'll be going again in the future and we'll see how they hold up. We just think this is a great find for real Indian food farther from Edison. And it definitely helps that almost everyone we saw there were South Asian.
