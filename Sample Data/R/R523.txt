The negative reviews seem way off. While $5 is high for a mango lassi it was large and good, and the food prices are on the low side. I liked the $13 Saravana special dinner (menu says availability is limited.) Intriguing variety of items, including a surprisingly thing with beets and spices. I haven't been into beets but this was a great combo. While I'm usually into meatier restaurants, this place spotlights how vegetarian joints can get really creative. The cheese masala dosa was so appealing that my dining companion had to politely warn me that I was taking too much of it.
