If there were 0 stars, I would have given that. Worst service ever. We were the first customers. Got just our coffee and couple of appetizers. Did not get food for more than an hour while we saw food coming out for other customers who came in. We requested and reminded the server about our order only to find food coming out for table beside us who had walked in 45min after us. Totally irresponsible management. The positive - whatever little food we tasted was good.
