I agree with the previous review and couldn't believe the ratings this place got !
It was absolutely amazing both in ambience and food. I went in for a lunch.
Ordered Bisibelabath and it was out of this world. Perfect amount of spice and butter.
The hostess was quite endearing and felt very comfortable. Not to mention I was in a hurry and the food arrived pretty quickly. Also I felt the food prices were quite cheap actually .. but then again I am used to the DC-arlington prices !
