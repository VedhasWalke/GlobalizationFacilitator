I am writing this review because I came to this restaurant at closing time. And the owner instead of rejecting, he served me food. I ordered chicken malai and butter naan. The chicken pieces were very soft, I would rate them 10/10 and the whole chicken malai would get 9/10. Naan were not that great. I would give it 6or7/10. Overall experience was great. The lighting, seating and art, the whole experience was like I am siting in a high end restaurant in India. I would recommend this place to other to try once at least. I have read the old reviews because of them I wasn't going to but because of restaurant being near to my location I came here. Don't know about veg food neither about other dishes.
