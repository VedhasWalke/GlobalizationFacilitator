Horribly disappointing. I came with high hopes based on this brand's good reputation, only to have them dashed. Very limited menu, and the waiters were extremely unhelpful when asked about alternatives or substitutions. My family and I avoid certain ingredients and generally we find veg South Indian restaurants are more than happy to accommodate us; SB's response was the opposite. I wouldn't have even minded as much, but their attitudes stunk too-- basically they acted as if it was a chore to serve us and carried scowls on their faces. And the place was practically empty, so one can't even make the excuse of them being too busy or overworked. The ambiance is pretty blah-- they get plus points for being clean, but the place lacks character. The food itself (the few things we could eat) wasn't terrible (hence two stars rather than one), but nothing at all to write home about and not worth the unnecessarily high prices. Avoid.
