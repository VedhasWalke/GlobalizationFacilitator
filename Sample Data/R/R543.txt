Been to Saravana Bhavan at least twice in the past 60 days.  Food used to be good when this place started out.  The last two visits  - the food was disgusting to say the least.  I thought that when the food was bad during the first visit in the past 60 days, it was just a bad day for them.  But, not quite.  Went there for the second time and the food continues to taste bad and not fresh.  I agree with some of the reviewers.  The Medu Vada was soft and soggy and likely refried.  It was like a sponge with a half gallon of oil in it.  The Chutneys were not good at all.  And the Rava Kesari was totally lacking taste.  All in all, I like to forget that this place even exists from this point on.  If you want to get a sore throat from poor quality oil and overuse of oil, and if you want to spend your evening eating stale food and most of it likely microwaved and thrown at you - this is the right place to go.  If not, please STAY AWAY from it.
