We ordered takeout.  The garlic naans were kinda hard instead of puffy, it feels like old bread being reheated.  The salty yogurt drink was extremely salty and mostly liquid rather than real yogurt, and the dairy didn't taste fresh neither.  The sweet cheese balls in honey syrup (dessert) was less cheese in the balls with no honey at all, they were soaked in syrupy water, tasted pure sugar rather than honey.  The vegetarian dish was heavy with big ginger bits, I tasted more ginger than the actual vegetables.  All in all, everything was disappointing.  They were definitely cutting corners on some of the dishes, trying to save cost by providing inferior qualities.  Well, this is not the way to thrive in business.
