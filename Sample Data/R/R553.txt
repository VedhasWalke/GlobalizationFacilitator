Crown of India Cafe is a new and hip eatery in West Windsor, NJ, featuring an eclectic menu of both North and South Indian delicacies! One of the added benefits for morning train commuters is that they can grab breakfast in the morning! How awesome is that?! Each item on the menu has been carefully crafted to excite the tastebuds! It is a must eat place for date nights, private dinner parties (and a great private room to go along), family get-togethers and more! Trust me... you won't be disappointed!!
