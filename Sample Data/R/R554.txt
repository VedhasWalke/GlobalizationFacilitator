Kati roll and Frankie were nothing close.  They put chili paneer in a wrap.  The restaurant does NOT know how a kati roll or frankie is made, perhaps try it first to understand and then attempt to sell it. I said MILD they made it spicy.
However, the manager reciprocated humbly and professionally, that goes a long way.
