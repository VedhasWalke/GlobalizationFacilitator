The main thing is, the food is outstanding. Very informal surroundings with TVs on, plastic wine glasses, no tablecloths, etc., so if you're expecting a nice/fancy dinner environment, this isn't it. But the Indian food is among the best in the area and reasonably priced, and everyone is very friendly. So overall a very positive experience every time I've been there.
