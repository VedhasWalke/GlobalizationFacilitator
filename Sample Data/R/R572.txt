A colleague and I visiting the area were looking for Indian food for dinner. Upon reading reviews we decided to try it out and we were so very happy. Very good meals decent prices and a nice atmosphere. It's well worth getting away from the main drag and going to dinner here. Lots of locals. You can bring in your own wine!
