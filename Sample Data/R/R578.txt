Great food but worst-in-class customer service experience from the short manager guy that usually is the first person you see in the front - they got my wife's order wrong, which is fine as it happens sometimes, but this guy gave a horrible attitude when my wife asked for the order to be fixed.
She had specified at least twice that she wanted a takeout order from the executive luncheon menu, and instead they gave her a dinner order at a much higher price. They showed no willingness to correct the order though, and even when she politely asked for a side order of naan at least (the lunch comes with naan but the dinner doesn't), he angrily threw a ripped brown bag with some naan in it at her and then he stormed away without apologizing for the original mistake.
It's a shame as I really like their food and used to go there almost weekly, but I can no longer go there after this experience. There are plenty of good Indian-food alternatives in the area that don't treat their paying customers like this. Watch out for this guy, or better yet, don't patron this restaurant at all.
