We took some friends visiting from India  to Cross Culture for lunch.
We had booked table in advance and were seriously late. We were greeted with smile. No problem with being late. We chose a table outside and 10 minutes later changed our mind. They gladly moved us inside the restaurant.
We ordered Navratan Korma, Bhindi Masala, Mutter Panir and Samosa with Nan and roti. The bottle of white wine we brought from home was placed in ice bucket with a white napkin!
Everything was delicious. Even the guests from Mumbai, India were pleased. Very friendly and competent staff made us feel welcomed.
We will be back!
