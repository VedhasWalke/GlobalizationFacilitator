Very nice Indian restaurant with excellent service. Stopped by here with friends when I was visiting the area.
We order a couple of dishes to share.
Rogan Josh
Tandoori special
Fish Tikka Masala
Baingan Bhartha
Bhindi Masala
Everything was flavorful and fantastic. The tandoori meats were tender and juicy. The entrees came with plenty of rice and naan.
I have a feeling that the heat level is dialed down quite a bit. Other than that, I feel that the flavor are spot on.
Service was also fantastic the whole way through. Would definitely be back again.
