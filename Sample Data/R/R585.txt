It was my first time going to cross culture. So I was exciter to try to karahi they had. But it turned out to be just a regular masala little drier curry. I enjoyed it but not as karahi which was on menu. They a little lazy to serve roti or naan what they call it. Sitting having lunch with family makes it look word when there less naans it no naans left and we keep waiting for servers to see and ask them to bring more.
