A 45 minute journey begins with great anticipation and excitement....because the destination results in Cross Culture, one of our favorite Indian restaurants.  Multiple trips later, the experience consistently stands up to expectations, with delicious Indian food, good ambience, and a friendly, polite staff.  Standout favorites include the assorted pakora appetizer, and the tandoori grill sampler.  Worth the trip every time!
