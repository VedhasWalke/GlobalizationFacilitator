This is our goto indian Resturant in the area.  Food is very good, grilled items are excellent.  Curries well made and balanced flavor and spice.  Chicken and lamb curries are great.We did my in-laws 50th anniversary dinner here and the owners were very accommodating. Kids love the place.  Takeout quality is also great.  Keep in mind place gets busy on Friday and Saturdays.
Its BYOB...liquor store across the mall so very convenient.
