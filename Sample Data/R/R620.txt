The lunch specials are a great deal. It comes with pakora, naan, rice, daal, and your choice of entree.  My favorite dish is the chicken cashmere. It is a little difficult to get the entree to come out with the right amount of spice level. It seems to come on the milder side, so even though I like the spice level medium, I ask for 10 out of 10 spiciness level.
**edit 1/2016 the last two times I've been here, the spiciness level has increased. 8 out of 10 spiciness has the perfect amount of kick for me
