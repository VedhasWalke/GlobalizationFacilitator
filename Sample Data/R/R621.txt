Don't really have too much experience with Indian Cuisine, but this place is pretty awesome. The ambiance is just right, and the service is top notch. The food itself was also pretty awesome. Friend and I both got the lamb, tho seasoned(?) differently? Anyways, I think we should have just skipped the food and went to dessert tho. We got the Kulfi and it was.. THE. BEST. THING. EVER.
