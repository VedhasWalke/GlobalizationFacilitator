I wish I was synesthetic, because then the bright orange paneer masala might have tasted of something, instead of colored, unsweetened whipping cream. The malai kofta was just as disappointing, as were the hara-bhara kebabs which were more like pakoras. I could not find the paneer in the paneer kulcha. Somehow even the chutneys were tasteless, which is a pretty hard feat to achieve. Would not recommend.
