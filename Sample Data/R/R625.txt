I used to be a big fan of this place. My husband and I were there the other night and there was a MOUSE running across the floor! I told the waiter quietly so I didn't disturb other patrons' meals (even  though other people saw it and commented) and he laughed and walked away. My first thought is - if you see mice in their dining room, their kitchen must be worse. Needless to say, we lost our appetites and ran out of there! Won't be returning...
