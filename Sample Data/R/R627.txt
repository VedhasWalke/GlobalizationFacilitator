Everytime I go to this place for lunch I pig out - I just can't help myself!   It's a lot of fun if you can go to this place with several people & order different dishes.  The vegetarian dishes are always spot on & very good.  Lamb Vindaloo definitely is spicy if you order it at level 8 but it is excellent as well as the chicken tikka marsala.   Rice & naan come with the meal as well as an appetiter that is fried & crunchy & excellent!  This is a BYO place.  Definitely check it out if you are into Indian food!
