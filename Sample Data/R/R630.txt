Well let's just say I was always skeptical of trying Indian food not knowing good from bad. So when this place was recommended by a great Indian friend I finally decided to take the plunge.  What a great recommendation it was. Don't think I'll ever go elsewhere. My wife & I have had almost everything on the menu & nothing disappoints. Just be careful if you're not into spicy, you'll need to specify this when ordering. The lassi's there I could probably have 3 of them myself. Only thing we haven't tried yet is dessert, maybe the next time around. Btw, the staff, ALWAYS warm & friendly & never too overbearing.
