This food is ok for takeout, however they certainly have some attitude problems. Two of us arrived on a Sunday night at 6pm when there were endless tables available. We were told it might be hard with no reservation. (the place was empty)
They proceeded to just make us wait and they were hardly accomadating. I've been a good customer in the past; however it's hard to support such bad service. Better Indian food and service on Chambers Street.
