Love this place! The ambiance inside is cozy and romantic at night. My boyfriend and I are both vegan AND gluten-free, so it can be tough finding places that understand both restrictions and are willing to accommodate them. Naveen, a manager at the restaurant, was able to give us a plethora of options and is well-versed in V/GF needs. We wanted to try a few things since it was our first time visiting. We ordered the baingan bhartha, chana masala, and the vegetable jalfrezi with a side of papadam (spiced lentil flour bread - a favorite of mine at any Indian restaurant). The baingan bhartha, chana masala, and papadam are automatically V/GF, but the vegetable jalfrezi you'll have to ask for a modification to be done to the sauce on the dish. The modified sauce (I forget the name of it) was spicy and tasty. All four of the dishes were delicious. The portion sizes were solid, as well. I have high standards for Indian food and this fits the bill. Just ask for Naveen and you'll be all set! I highly recommend dining here.
