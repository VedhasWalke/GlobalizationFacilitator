I had expected to be impressed based on some reviews - but no.  Food was good enough.  Their seven day a week "Executive Lunch" is fairly priced - ranging from $9.00 to $15.00. I had the shrimp tikki masala ($14) which were four large shrimp in a rather mild sauce.  My wife that the tandorri chicken combo ($15) which was nice as well.  Both came with standard sides, naan, basmati rice, pakora puffs and paneer in a mild sauce.  Food came out of the kitchen fast and hot.  But not spicey.
Decor is OK but rather ordinary. Seating is a combination of bench seats and chairs.  My wife told me that the bench was uncomfortable, too hard and set too high. Service was a little off.  My entree came out four or five minutes before my wife's tandoori, not such a big deal since we were sharing the shrimp.  But then a food runner, not our waiter, brought my wife's entree to the next table. They were going - it's not ours - so my wife spoke up to get her food. Awkward.  
Background music was something Indian, instrumental, I was not impressed - I have better Indian music on my iPod.
Too many other places to try in Princeton. But not all that bad for lunch.
