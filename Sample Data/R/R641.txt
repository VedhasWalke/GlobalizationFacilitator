Excellent food,  ambience & service. I had Malabar paratha,  aloo palak curry , vegetable biriyani. The chaats were so delicious & lip smacking along with malabar paratha. The portions for the aloo curry were more than enough for two people. Vegetable biriyani also is also more than enough for two people & equally aromatic & delicious.
Definitely recommend for die hard foodies.
