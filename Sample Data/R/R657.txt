Love this place! This is my to go Indian restaurant when I am in the Princeton area. Been here for both and dinner. Lunch is definitely the way to go though, it's the same portion as dinner with more sides! The service is great and the food comes in a timely fashion. My favorite dish is the chicken vindaloo, its super spicy but I love it! The malai kofta is very delicious as well.
