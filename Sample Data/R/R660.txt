I live downtown Philly and can be spoiled by Ekta, Inde Blue and other great options for solid indian food in town. i would rate this place an absolute average at best. Tikka masala was recognizable mostly by sauce color but the meat texture resembled some processed chicken deli meat rather than tandoor cooked marinated chicken cubes...the portions were on the smaller side too. On the other hand, lamb biryani was delicious while a few other things we tried - fish curry and a couple of others - were just meh. I would choose a different spot next time i am in the vicinity.
