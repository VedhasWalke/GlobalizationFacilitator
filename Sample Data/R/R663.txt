Met a friend for lunch during the week, definitely a great atmosphere and friendly staff - very attentive.
We ordered the lunch specials of chicken tikka masala and chicken korma, they were very good.  I have had better although here I would definitely come back for it since it is close to my work and convenient.  I LOVE that they give an unlimited amount of naan bread and rice - I can eat that all day!!!  The apps that came with the lunch, I can't remember what they were but it was definitely good - love that the dip sauces had the spice kick that I was looking for.
The price was really definitely worth it for the food we received, our bill was $23 for the two of us.  I left there happy, full and satisfied - would come back and bring more friends and/or get take out!
