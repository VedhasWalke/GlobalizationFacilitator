I haven't written a yelp review in a long time, but I had to log on so I could review Cross Culture. Yesterday, I had the biggest craving for Indian food. I wanted to swing by some of my favorite spots near Somerville on the way home, but waiting for food and battling that circle of death 206 circle made me think of places closer to home. I was going to hit up a couple of spots in downtown, but I found this place in the Harrison STreet shopping center and saw that it was new and gave it a try.
So good! I ordered chicken korma, an order of samosas, and naan - typical fare for me. The chicken is soo good- creamy, tender, and full of so much flavor. The rice was fluffy and fresh, and the naan was good. The samosas were also amazing- you get three large samosas an order. The chutneys and sauces that came along with it, very good too.
Anyway, I'm going to have to try dining in one time (hence the 4 star review) so I can experience it fully. My fiance isn't so much into Indian food, but maybe this will change his mind. I also like that it's closer than going into downtown princeton and that there is ample parking. The server who took my take-out order was very friendly.
