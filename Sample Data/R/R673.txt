I went with my parents for Mother's Day today, and she was very impressed!  We ordered the Lamb Saagwali for my dad, a basket of garlic naan, the Mixed Tandoori Grill (which included chicken, mutton, salmon, and shrimp) as well as the Chicken Cashmere.  As we didn't make a reservation, we did wait about 30 minutes, but the waiter was very helpful in updating us on the seating situation, and also accommodating in bringing us an extra chair outdoors as well as packing us an extra box of rice.  All were delicious sauces that we enjoyed, particularly the Chicken Cashmere with cashews and golden raisins in a cream sauce.  The mango lassi was also the first positive experience I had with the right consistency.
The only thing I'd say would be disappointing is the Persian Falooda we ordered, which might just be because we read the description but didn't realize it was a very odd combination of noodles embedded in the ice cream and fruit seeds, which was really weird and an odd texture.
That said, my mom would definitely bring her friends back, but perhaps stick with the safer mango desserts for next time.
