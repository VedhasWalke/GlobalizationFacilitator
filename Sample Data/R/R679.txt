We went for dinner and had seen the positive reviews on this place.  We were not disappointed - the appetizers came out nice, and the main dishes were also good.
I think they had gone with a more cozy look and had the lights turned down but that made it hard to read the menu etc.
We would probably eat here again next time we are in the area.
