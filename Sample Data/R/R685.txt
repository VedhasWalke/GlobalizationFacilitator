The food is excellent and the staff is very friendly.  I've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, but mostly get take-out.  The food has always been fresh and I always get greeted warmly when I go in to pick up my order.   Love their garlic naan.  Try their mutter panir.  The cheese just melts in your mouth.
The atmosphere in the restaurant is great.  I took a friend there once for lunch and she loved it too.  Said it was the best Indian food she had tasted in the area.
I highly recommend it.
