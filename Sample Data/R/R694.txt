This is an omnivorous restaurant that is extremely receptive to vegan customers.  You can call or email ahead of time or just speak to the waitstaff when you come to dine; they understand what vegan means, will point out the vegan menu items, and even offer additional suggestions/options.  
The pretty dining room is spotless and the food is terrific.  Be sure to ask for extra spicy (the scale is 1-10; next time I'm requesting a 15!).  I will be returning soon and often.
