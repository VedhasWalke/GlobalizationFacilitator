Delicious! I'm not into super spicy food, so I was pleasantly surprised to find these dishes only mildly spiced, yet packed with flavor. My bf and I ordered the Aloo Tikki appetizer, Lamb Biryani, Mutter Panir, and plain Naan. Very filling with leftovers to take home. The food here beats the Indian food on Nassau St. I will definitely come back again!
