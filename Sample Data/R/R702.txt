Delicious food, excellent service and executive lunch is a deal. We went in there expecting a regular so so food. We ordered Palak Paneer and Malai Kofta and I couldn't believe how flavorful it was - as close as it can get to what you get in good restaurants in India. Food was not at all greasy and spices were mixed up very well, paneer was soft and the mali kofta gravy was just right. Seriously I haven't had this kind of experience in NJ in a long time. Will go back again.
