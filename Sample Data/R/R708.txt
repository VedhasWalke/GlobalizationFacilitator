My friends love Indian food but I would always have to decline their invitations because I can't have dairy and i have zero tolerance for spicy heat, spicy is good but heat isn't. Well I'm happy to have found a restaurant where they are hyper vigilant with my dietary restrictions and they tailored the heat without sacrificing the delicious spices. Some may gripe about it not being very "authentic" and maybe pricey. However, their attentiveness to my culinary challenges and the ability to join my friends at an Indian restaurant was priceless to me.
