Food is great as usual. We love the mixed grill and curry. People are nice and the decor is pleasant. Recently this restaurant has been very busy. There is a bit of wait even with reservation. Prices are on the high side.  Table for 2 are a bit too small to accommodate a bottle of wine, 2 glasses of water, 1 curry, 1 mixed grill, naan and rice. Wish would have been a couple of inches wider. Anyway most important is the food. because it has become really busy we decided to look for an alternative Indian but we will still go back there from time to time, because of the high quality of their food and professionalism of the people.
