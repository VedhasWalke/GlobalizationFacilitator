Been here a couple times for lunch with coworkers. Food is strictly ok. They provide a bowl of naan and a complimentary sabji dish for a table. Everything tastes bland inspite of asking for a spicy level. Not that food is bad, but it just tastes average and quantity is a bit on lower side. The menu doesnt offer anything special, just the usual indian fare.One time I found a hair in food, the manager apologised and replaced the dish. Ambience is better , service is good. Good to eat here if you dont have any other options.
