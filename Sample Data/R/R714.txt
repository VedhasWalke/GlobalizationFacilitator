this restaurant has very standard menu items; it is tidy, well run and super clean with nice decor. The food, however, is pretty bland. I asked them to make it spicy, but it was bland, so I pretty much emptied the pepper shaker out on my plate. They did not ask me "1-10," and probably just did not believe me. I took my sag paneer home and will just put some chili powder and Jamaican Jerk seasoning in it and it will be good to go.
