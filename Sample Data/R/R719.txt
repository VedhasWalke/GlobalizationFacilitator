Good menu, good food and good location (unlike Princeton downtown that can take longer to drive in and park). Bit pricey, but BYOB more than makes up for it. Ambience can be improved as can the cultural training and interactions of the staff who come across (without meaning to) not too polite and sophisticated in interactions. I recommend the place.
