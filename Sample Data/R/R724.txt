This is by far our favorite indian restaurant if not our top restaurant period.The food is the best the service is great very friendly people and especially lunch you get tons of food all these free extras and its so cheap.Extremely fresh we go all the time and its always great.If i lived closer i would ge alot more.Don`t miss it!
