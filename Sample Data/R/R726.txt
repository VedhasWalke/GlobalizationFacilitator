Cross Culture is one of our all-time favorite restaurants in Princeton! The moment you walk in the door, the staff makes you feel at home! The first time we went in, we were unsure what to order and our waiter recommended a few popular options, based on our likes we described to him. Since we moved to the area and our first visit just 6 months ago, we've been hooked! Every time we have visitors, we bring them in!!!! My absolute favorite is the garlic naan, chicken saagwala and tandoori chicken!! Love the place, atmosphere and hospitality!!!
