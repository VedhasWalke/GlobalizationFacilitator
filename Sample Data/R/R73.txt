We got a 15% off coupon in our mail and after reading the reviews which were mostly very good we decided to give it a chance. Huge mistake. First, we went there on a Friday night, and it was pretty empty. We immediately realized it was not a good sign. It took them forever to take our order. While we were waiting for the dishes to come, I took a sip of water from the glass and realized it had unwashed red lipstick on it (not mine)! I returned it immediately. The chicken makhani was far below average; I left most of the chicken since it had a pretty bad taste, very hybrid feel and it was probably not cooked on the same day. The naan was ok, but nothing special.
