This is the only place I trust so far for non-spicy Indian food (because I can't take spicy foods well). I've been here literally dozens of times with my coworkers for lunch, and I've really enjoyed these dishes: Palak Panir, Navratna Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Cashmere, Lamb Saagwala, and Lamb Korma. The Pakoras are pretty good, and you get unlimited white rice.
