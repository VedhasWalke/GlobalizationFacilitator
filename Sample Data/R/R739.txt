Love this little gem tucked away in Princeton Shopping Center, right next to Taste of Mexico. Went there for the first time last night, and will definitely be back. I love Indian food, and have not been able to find a local Indian restaurant that I really like until now. The lamb biryani was delicious, as was the Tandoori chicken. Very excited about this place - the restaurant is well appointed, lighting is subdued and the booths are cozy. The service and food are both excellent. And as a bonus, it's BYO.
