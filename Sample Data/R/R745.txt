Just had a wonderful evening at this five-month-old find.  Mixed grill was generous, delicious, and as well prepared as it was sizzling when it arrived at the table.  Great samosas, Nan bread, and superb eggplant dish.  The service was extremely professional and friendly at the same time.  This is the best, most relaxing spot for Indian cuisine in the Princeton area.  Mmmm.
