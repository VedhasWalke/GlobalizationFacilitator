One of our favorite places for takeout in Princeton. Just about everything we've had from here has been good, and they consistently have the food ready on time. Only complaint is that they go a little crazy with the food coloring on some dishes.  The Haryali Murgh Tikka was tasty but colored a radioactive green color - I guess that was supposed to represent the mint in the marinade? I'm used to red tandoori chicken but not green! Anyway, it still tasted great.
