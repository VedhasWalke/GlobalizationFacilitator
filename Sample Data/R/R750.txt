We were around the spot, so ordered on the go and picked up the food. Ordered butter chicken, chicken biryani, samosas, chicken pepper fry & Idli sambar.
Pickup experience was great, especially during COVID. You enter the door and they have multiple to-go bags on the table. I do suggest they ask for the names when someone calls for the to-go order so we don't have to check each and every bag's food items to make sure which one is yours. Not too big of a deal.
All the items I ordered (mentioned above) were finger lickin' good except for the idli sambar. Maybe it was because we had an hour drive from the restaurant. Maybe it tastes better when it comes out fresh and you dine in the restaurant.
Anyway, great food. Will visit again!
