This is great spot for lunch. It is around $11 per person and is buffet style. I came on a Wednesday around 1pm and was surprised by how serene it was, given that there was a bit of a crowd.
The layout of the restaurant makes it so that the tables are close but there is ample room around the buffet so it doesn't feel crowded. There are multiple vegetarian and meat options -- all very authentic and fresh! In total they had about 12 food options laid out, including a dessert item. I have recommended it to my friends to come and visit as it is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall. I appreciate how authentic the food was, and how fair the price is.
They have a sign indicating how much food waste they had the night before to encourage patrons to only take as much as they can eat, which I thought was very considerate.
Note: you are formally seated like a regular restaurant, but then get your own food like a buffet, and pay at the front. You can request that they bring the check to your table, though.
