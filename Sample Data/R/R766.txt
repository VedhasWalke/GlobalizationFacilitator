Second visit and just as great as the first.  I'm only going 4 stars, would give 4-1/2 if I could, the missing 1/2 or whole star is due to the staff.  There clearly is a language barrier which hurts the interaction and service is 50% of the dining experience.
Now onto the food which was fabulous.
Started with an app order of the street samosa -- tri-folded puff pastry with potatoes, chilies, mint, cilantro and chat masala. (Vegan)-- so fresh and not the typical fried crunch exterior found elsewhere.  This plate was delicate.  Our second app order of the Jeenga e Aatish-- plump fresh jumbo prawns refreshingly marinated in citrus juice, ajwain and green cardamom, grilled in tandoor. Very tasty.  
For our main, we ordered two dishes to share-- old Delihi Butter Chicken-- pulled tandoori chicken cooked in butter, tomato sauce, aromatic spices. Was light, awesome flavor, smelled wonderful.  Moist pieces and shared the nilgiri lamb kurma-- cubes of lamb slowly simmered in coconut, fresh herbs & spices. Very tasty, the lamb was tender and a great flavorful sauce for dipping of our garlic naan order.
The plating presentation of each item was.. well worth photos, so see our photos as well.
Back to the servers, they were attentive, anything we needed, but they need to be more approachable, more friendly as many dinners will not be as accustomted to their cooking style and will have questions.
