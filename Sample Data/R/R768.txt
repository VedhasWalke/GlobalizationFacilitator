We've gotten take out here several times and have always been very pleased.  Orders are ready when promised and piping hot.  Everything is wrapped thoroughly and even if the bag tipped over in the car, there would be no spillage or leakage.
Our go to menu items are the old Dehli butter chicken and the vegetable korma.  Both are delicious!  The garlic Naan and street samosas are also very good.
Portions are generous and despite gorging ourselves we always seem to have leftovers to enjoy the next day, which is a bonus!
