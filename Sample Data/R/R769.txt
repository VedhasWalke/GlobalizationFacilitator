This restaurant has declined since its opening.  It feels like it has changed ownership (don't know if that is true) and are trying to save money.
The food is tasty, but they skimp on ingredients.  On my prior visit, we ordered butter chicken and Paneer Tikka Masala.  Both very tasty, but not enough chicken pieces, mostly sauce.  Same goes with the paneer - tasty but not enough paneer.
Our recent trip, we ordered Navaratan Korma and Masala Dosa.  Both tasted great, but not enough veggies in the korma and not enough stuffing in the dosa.
We also ordered the Gobi Manchurian - not very good.
Ultimately, it tastes great, but not enough fillings.  We decided that we're going elsewhere next time.
