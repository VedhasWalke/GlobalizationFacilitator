We had wanted to try this place for a while because I am such a lover of South Indian food, and being named Chennai, I was expecting a lot- but I have to say it was a little disappointing because I wanted more than your average meal. In addition to the food quality there were only some South Indian dishes on the buffet spread, certainly not a majority- and they were the best of the dishes I sampled. The dambar was good, as was the vegetable poriyal. My boyfriend who likes North Indian dishes and eats meat was happy but not overjoyed with his meal either. Not a bad experience, just weren't wowed. An average buffet for the area, and a bit more costly than others...
