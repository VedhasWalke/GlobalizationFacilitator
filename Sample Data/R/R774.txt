This restaurant lived up to its high reviews!! The food was so delicious - we ordered  chili paneer, dosa, malai kofta and it was absolutely the delicious. The servers were so friendly and considerate. We felt very safe dining in during COVID-19, all staff wore masks and the restaurant had a very elegant ambience. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Princeton area.  It has homey vibes while still being a classy, beautiful restaurant
