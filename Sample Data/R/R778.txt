Dined here for the first time for lunch today (Wednesday) around 1:00pm (no wait time) with a group of 4 other friends and was pleasantly surprised by the lunch special, which is a good deal. For around $10-$13 per person, you order an entree, which comes with a starter, naan/roti, dahl, rice, and dessert, allowing for a complete meal! I started with the Gobi 65 (fried cauliflower florets), which was nice and crispy. For my main meal, I ordered the palak paneer, which was flavorful and had well-cooked paneer cubes. I only wish that the dish had been a bit spicier or that they asked for spice level preference. In addition I was a fan of their naans - we asked for multiple refills for the table.
As we were a group of 5 relatively young patrons, I was surprised that they didn't allow us to do separate checks, especially being located in a college town with many student restaurant-goers. They do allow you to split the check, but only with a max of 3 cards, so one of our friends ended up fronting the bill and we venmo-ed him back - just something to be aware of.
