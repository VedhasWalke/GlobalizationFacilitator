Friend and I came here for dinner around 7. It wasn't too crowded when we came but it was right before a big reserved party came. The service was good until it got busy because there were only 3 waiters. When we asked for the check, it took the waiter 15 minutes.
The food was very mediocre. Would not recommend for vegetarian eaters. Maybe my friend and I just ordered badly but the whole meal was basically carbs. We got the Madurai Idly, Ennai Kathirikai, Podi Dosa, and the bread basket. The Madurai was three pieces of steamed bread, the Ennai was an eggplant and tomato curry, the podi was a crepe with only spices on it, and the bread basket was 3 pieces of naan. The menu doesn't do a good job with descriptions and telling you what anything really is. The only thing that tasted alright was the Ennai. Everything else was heavy and dense.
