The food at Chennai Chimney is pretty good, nothing exceptional.  I wish it were spicier, and I wish the curries had more meat.  
The 5-star review goes to the lunch buffet, which is open every single day (11:30am-2:30pm), has a pretty good selection (soup, fried dishes, curries, veggies, dessert), and costs only $11.
Get the buffet "to go" for $9.45. They give you a massive to-go tray which you can load up at the buffet, plus they make you fresh naan. I usually fit more food in the to-go box than I can eat in person, so it's a win-win.
