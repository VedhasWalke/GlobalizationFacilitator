I came to this restaurant for the first time on a Friday evening. I ordered my favorite Indian dish. Why I gave this restaurant only three stars instead of four was because the food took a very long time to come, probably close to 45 minutes, because half the kitchen was inoperable. We were not told this before we ordered, and that would have been courteous to the customers. Other people walked out before they got their food, and others were about to walk out when their food came. So this review is mostly about the management not telling the customers. about expected delays, and nothing about the food itself. I might come back to this restaurant for the lunch buffet, but probably not again for dinner. The food itself was definitely good, though.  Just my experience here.
