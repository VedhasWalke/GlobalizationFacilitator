Best Indian food in the area. Just super good all around. The butter chicken is very flavorful and not a boring choice. It goes well with the garlic naan and some masala chai for dessert. The dosas are to die for. Just make sure you come here very hungry. I usually come here on a weeknight, and service has always been excellent.
