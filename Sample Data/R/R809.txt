The food is good but the service is horrible. We got the mushroom munchurian as an appetizer and it was our first time trying this preparation in a vegetarian style. The mushroom munchurian blew our minds as it was sweet, spicy and crunchy all at the same time. We did not get any watery or overpowering taste of mushrooms. A well prepared dish. We had specifically asked for onion uttapam for one of our entrees. When it came out, there were no onions in it. When we alerted the waiter, he asked us to turn the uttapam upside down and blatantly said there are onions in it when clearly there were no onions in there. We then alerted a second waiter who acknowledged the mistake and asked the kitchen to make us another uttapam. Meanwhile the first waiter (who asked us to turn the uttapam upside down) came to us and said the second waiter made a mistake with the order. Anyway, finally we got the uttapam with onions but it seemed to be cooked in such a hurry that the middle was raw. Thankfully we had ordered a second entree of Old Delhi butter chicken which saved the meal. The Old Delhi Butter Chicken was creamy, tangy,  had a delicate amount of spice and was finger licking good. Some of the  best butter chicken we have eaten with garlic naan. Go to this place for the food, not the service
