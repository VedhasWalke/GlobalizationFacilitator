We went to try it's lunch buffet for around $12.  I personally like it since it's ingredients are fresh and not like the other lunch buffet that those sauces are usually really bland.  I don't have problems having bloating, stomach discomfort, I definitely will go back for the lunch and also want to try their food in the dinner time.
