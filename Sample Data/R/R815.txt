Seems like my wait for a good South Indian restaurant to open in Princeton is over! I walked into Chennai Chimney for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised to find them to be serving some authentic South Indian food.
I must say that they are going through a 'soft opening' and this is my first visit to the restaurant.
I ordered the Mini Thali from the lunch menu. The presentation of the food was great! They have custom branded ceramic plates for appetizers and the thali came in a copper plate with banana leaves. The food was tasty, fresh and well spiced unlike many generic Indian restaurants that dilute the flavoring. All in all, a good experience.
I spoke to the chef and he said that they are in the midst of doing food tastings as they build up their menu. I hope they keep up the good work and stay authentic.
