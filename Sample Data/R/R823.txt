Came here for lunch with coworkers. The lunch special was excellent - ordered Gobi 65 as my starter (picture attached). It was the best of all starters. The outside was crunchy and the inside cauliflower was good. Also tried the Kozhi 65 which had a kick of flavor but couldn't bear the Gobi. The Old Delhi Butter Chicken was spicy and flavorful. The naan was a perfect combo to dip in the sauce. Lots of food for a great price. Also tried the mango lassi for the first time, wow! The dessert was ok, not used to the spices. I'd give this place five stars but it took almost 2 hours for a group of 10 to get our food. That said, the quality of the food was excellent!! Will come back!
