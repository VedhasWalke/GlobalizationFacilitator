Changing my review...I had a great experience last time, but it has gone SIGNIFICANTLY DOWNHILL since. Terrible service, took forever for the guy to take our order, and with such an attitude! The salad came, and we had to get our own plates from the stack on the corner table, to split it, because the waiter was nowhere to be found. The masala dosa was nice and crisp but DEVOID OF FLAVOR this time. So disappointing, because we were excited. They also didn't have any change for the cash I gave, so I was forced to tip way more than I wanted to. Don't even get me started on the salty lime soda that tasted like sweat, with no lime or ginger.
