The food here is FANTASTIC! Not your standard northern Indian fare (because, obviously, this is a southern Indian restaurant). Everything we ate was great, including vegetarian kofta, my husband's specialty lamb dish, the rice, and the naan. The service, however, was bizarrely lacking. The waiter was strangely absent, taking a long time to take our order and ask how the food was. When he did take our order, he never said "hello" to us. Only, "Your order please." When he uncorked our bottle of wine, he didn't pour it.
If you can get past the bad service and just enjoy the food, you'll be fine.  I decided it was worth it.
