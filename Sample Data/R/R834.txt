Pretty place for dinner with family and friends.
We had to wait for awhile, but it was worth it. (it gets pretty busy on Friday for dinner)
The servers were very helpful and friendly enough to explain and recommend the best food.
I would come back here again for their garlic naan and butter chicken.
