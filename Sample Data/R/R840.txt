Authentic South Indian food right here in downtown Princeton. Excellent selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian South Indian traditional dishes prepared from scratch, tastes like they were prepared in my grandma's kitchen. Every dish is cooked to order and hence may take a little extra time to get to the table, but well worth the wait. We been regulars since they opened this restaurant last year and will continue to visit them often.
Remember to make a reservation if you do not want to wait. Enjoy!
