I read the reviews and decided I would try this restaurant.  When I arrived on Wednesday about 12:30PM, there was nobody there but the waiters.  I asked to be seated next to a window, but they refused because it was a table for four.
They quickly gave me the lunch menu, which had decent prices.  After receiving the food, I see that one gets a lot of food for the money--a plus.  I got a vegan dish, which is mixed vegetables in a sort of sauce.  It was okay but nothing extraordinary.  It came with some dal, rice, and desert.  The tomato soup that came as an appetizer was excellent.  Real tomatoes, good taste with a little spice.  
The waiters stopped by briefly while eating to ask how it was and to fill up water.  Nothing too intrusive.  The waiter had forgotten the internet password, so I couldn't use their internet while eating alone there.
While eating there, two tables of four people did come in finally.  Not many customers at lunch.  I hope they have more customers in evenings.
This was an okay Indian restaurant.  Maybe other dishes were more remarkable.  But, I was full and had enouh leftovers almost for another meal, at a good price.
