Amazing food. I've been waiting for so long for a good South Indian restaurant and they offer so much more than that. My favorites so far - the Fried Okra, the Kozhi 65, the Egg Parotta. Really nice ambience and great food. It's good to have them in Princeton. Will be back for sure!
Update: I tried making a reservation and had a bad experience with calls unreturned and had to find an alternate venue. Not good. I'm revising my review down to three stars.
