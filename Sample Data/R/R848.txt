Very very expensive and the food is so what ok
Yesterday I went for the buffet lunch I saw that there was buffet me and my family enjoyed the food but when we asked for the bill I saw they where charging like 19 dollars for 1 person I was like really 19 dollars for the buffet I asked the waiter he said me 17.99 plus taxes are you putting gold in the food. I just lost all the fun looking at bill I am not cheap but its really a lot of money for this buffet 10 dollars or max 12 is ok for this buffet
