Came in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We are vegan and the buffet had a few vegan offerings but we decided to add a few items off the menu. All of the food was awesome! The manager, the chef and the servers were extremely helpful. When we got our bill they had included the two additional curries in the price of the buffet! Completely unnecessary but really nice. We will definitely eat here again.
