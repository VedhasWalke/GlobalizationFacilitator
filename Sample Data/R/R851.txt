The food here is amazing, the service fantastic and the environment warming! I hadn't had Indian food in a long time and was feeling it for dinner. We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try given the positive reviews and that it's BYOB. As soon as we talked in, the smell of Indian spices filled my nostrils. The main dining room is so homey it makes you feel like you're in someone's living room. We decided to go with the mushroom appetizer (pictured), as well as a chicken curry, a vegetarian curry all along with some naan. Everything tasted great and very authentic. Will definitely be back sometime soon! This will be my to-go place for Indian in Princeton going forward.
