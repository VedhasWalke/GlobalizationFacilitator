The food was fine. The restaurant is nice and decorated well. However, the whole experience was unpleasant at best. In an extremely rude fashion, upon bringing our food the wait staff literally set the entire *tray* of our food in front of me and walked away, expecting me to clean up the mess - I will never forget it. Very arrogant and disrespectful people working here. Do yourself a favor and stay away.
