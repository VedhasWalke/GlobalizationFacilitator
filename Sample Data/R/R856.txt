Food was tasty but portions are unusually small. The Goan fish curry had 3 very small cubes of fish. The menu is interesting as the dishes are South Indian specialties. Service is a bit rude and rushed. When I made the reservation the person who answered the phone was an absolute jerk.
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. In an area where there are plenty of choices, I recommend going elsewhere.
