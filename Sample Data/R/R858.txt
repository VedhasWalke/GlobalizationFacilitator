Went here the day after Thanksgiving. The prices are VERY high relative to the portion sizes. We counted 6 or so smallish cubes of chicken in a $15 tikka masala. If you are on a diet maybe tiny portions are a good thing but if you have a big appetite you better have deep pockets and plan on ordering 2 entrees a person. I mentioned to the owner that my fiance and I were still hungry after spending over $50 on food and he didn't seem to care.
