Restaurant was good, I ordered from the lunch menu and my friend paid for the lunch buffet. Buffet price was a LITTLE steep at $12.95, but it's not terrible. According to my friend, buffet food was good, choices were many but not common or super popular items. She wished there were more meat items on the buffet option. Desert was good. As for myself, my masala dosa was tasty and fresh, and filled with the potato onion filling. Served warm and fresh was a good flavor overall. Would definitely go back!
