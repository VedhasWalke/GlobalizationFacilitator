First and foremost, they have awesome and authentic food. You have a wide variety of curries, appetizers, breads, and kebabs to choose from and an option of three different spice levels: mild, medium, hot.
Also, the customer service is amazing. The waiters are kind and will help out in any way. They also have quick service and an awesome ambience. Another great added touch is the manager and owner. Awesome guy who wants to get to know his customers. Definitely going to come back!!
