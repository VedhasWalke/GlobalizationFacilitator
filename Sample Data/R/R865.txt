I was a little skeptical about having Indian food at Princeton, but this place had delicious food. We had the chicken ghee roast and the chicken parotta. Both of these dishes were delicious and hadn't lost their authenticity. What added to the whole experience was the super friendly and polite staff.  Would definitely come here again!
