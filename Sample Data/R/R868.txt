A quiet, friendly place with amazing food- plenty of vegan options! Lunch portions were a nice size (not too much, not too little). Appetizer, naan, and rice pudding dessert included for some dishes. Pricing is spot on too. Definitely worth taking a stroll around neighborhood and stopping in here to have some yummy Indian food!
