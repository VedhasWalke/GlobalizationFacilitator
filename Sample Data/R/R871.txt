In a town full of indian restaurants this was another one that falls into grand flow of things. The typical fare with a South Indian twist to the choices. The price accurately reflects the meal that you receive, not to little but not an overwhelming quantity either. If you are a party of 4 or more I recommend a reservation, it was crowded on a Friday night. if you enjoy Indian cuisine I would give this place a shot, and try Madurai Chukka Kari or some of the unique choices from the Chennai Specials section of the menu.
