Nice to see a South Indian restaurant in downtown Princeton. We enjoyed all the dishes we tried. Beware that they are pretty serious here about the spices, so if you want a mild curry you'll need to be very clear. The decor is an improvement on the previous restaurant. The service is friendly and well-meaning, but maybe just a touch clueless. It would be nice if they helped the patrons by packing up the leftovers nicely instead of simply dropping a DIY foil bag on the table for our uneaten dosa.  (We overordered.) There was nowhere to put the  sambar and other sauces, so we just brought the dosa home by itself, which was a little sad.
