We really didn't have a good experience there. I think it was more to do with the ambience that night than the food. The food was just OK! Nothing amazing! I have def had better South Indian food at half the cost. There was a big bday party table sorted right behind us and they were extremely loud and annoying. I was sitting right across from my Fiancé and we could hardly hear each other. The plating style was great and unique but that's about it.
