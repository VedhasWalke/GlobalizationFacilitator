I reviewed Chennai Chimney 3 months ago and gave them 5 stars and a rave review.  The food was delicious and still is.  The menu is replete with fascinating South Indian dishes.  Tonight, we enjoyed the Kaalan Manchurian appetizer, which was amazing.  Entrees were Chennai Avial and Nanjilnadu Kozhi curry, which were both absolutely wonderful.  
The service, though, is another matter.   We waited more than 1 1/2 hours for our dinner.  The people next to us received their dinner, ate, and left.  Another couple sat down at their table, ordered, enjoyed a leisurely meal, paid, and left.  Apparently, they forgot us.  They were quite apologetic, but despite the apologies, didn't pick up the pace.  Eventually, they brought our appetizer.  Later, my dinner arrived, which was lukewarm, as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for a long time.  They gave my wife a small bowl of rice, but didn't bring her entree.  I ate as slowly as I could, sharing with her.  Eventually, about 30 minutes later (again, after a number of complaints), they brought her dinner.   It would have been much more enjoyable if we could have enjoyed our dinners together, rather than eating sequentially.  We even had to wait more than an hour for a refill of water.  Altogether, our dinner lasted 2 hrs 45 minutes.  
My advice:  this is a great restaurant, if you are in the right frame of mind and want to spend an evening there.   Pretend that it is a posh Slow Food Movement restaurant and bring a good sense of humor.  The food is worth it.
