7 of us went at 6:30PM and we were told it was a 30 min max wait. 30 mins later they told us to wait another 40 mins, and at the same time they had other customers seated.... finally we were seated at 8:30pm and the food was just mediocre. I've had much better Indian cuisine elsewhere, this was NOT worth it. Very disappointed at this place.
