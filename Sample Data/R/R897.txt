Wonderful restaurant. Excellent service, food and atmosphere. I walked 30 minutes in the cold December night to get here and it was worth it. Really felt like a vacation. I got garlic naan and the fish curry. Excellent flavors, huge portions, and presentation. This place is a bit fancy, so expect to spend $15- $20 on an entree. Also, save room! They have desserts as well!
