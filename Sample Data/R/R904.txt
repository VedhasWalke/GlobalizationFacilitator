First time at this place, and a poor experience.
I ordered appam, which the menu said came with khorma, but the waiter brought it out with khorma. When I inquired about the missing khorma, he insisted that the appam does not come with it. After pressing the issue, he agreed to talk to the chef. The chef was adamant that dish does not come with khorma. I then asked for the menu, and showed the waiter that khorma is listed, at which point he went back to the chef, who finally agreed and offered to cook the khorma. At this point, I had already finished the appam, dipping it in an okra dish we had also ordered, and saw no purpose in eating khorma by itself. There was no offer to bring out more appam. The appam itself was not that great, but I was hungry, having waited almost half an hour for the food. And when the bill came, they had the temerity to charge full price for the appam!
The food itself is 3 star, though portions could be bigger, the okra dish was quite oily, and the appam fairly bland. The wait service though, I cannot believe a new restaurant would treat any customer like this, especially when we were the only ones there, halfway through another dinner party arrived. The ambiance is also lacking, as there is constant ringing of the owner's cellphone (clearly they have T-Mobile), and the caller ID that announces caller name. I miss Masala Grill.
