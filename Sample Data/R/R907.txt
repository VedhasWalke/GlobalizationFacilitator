Let's start with from the moment you walk in.
Once you step inside, it's like you are in your own home. You are received with a warm and welcoming greeting.  The Decor is SPOT ON and as my wife will always say you judge an establishment by the look of it's restroom - very clean.
The food in one word - Delectable!
The taste is delightfully enchanting.  You can taste each ingredient that brings the dish to life.  
As a connoisseur of Indian Cuisine and having been to dozens of Indian Restaurants in NYC and NJ this lovely establishment has separated itself from the masses and in my opinion can be crowned Number 1 and described as THE BEST Indian Restaurant in the  Tri-state area.  Princeton, you are lucky to have this place in your back yard.
