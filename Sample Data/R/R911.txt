This place has only been open for a month and they certainly need to work out a few more kinks.  We stopped in for the Sunday brunch, expecting a quick meal that did not happen.  The food was fresh, hot and often replenished.  That's the best I can say about our experience.  The service however was another story, there is a severe need for training for everyone in the front of the house. We were seated by a host and a young man filled our water glasses but we had summon him back to ask for tea. The staff were slow to clear our plates when we returned to the buffet.  Trying to pay was a mess; we couldn't get the attention of a server or the host.  After quite some time went to the counter to pay, there the host asked for our check which of course we hadn't been able to get.  The math involved in 2 fixed price buffet lunches and 2 glasses of chai (expensive at $3 for a thimble sized cup with no refill, not that a server even offered) seemed require a lot of thought at what must be a brand new register system.  
The food was good but unless they sort out the service this place is not your best choice.
