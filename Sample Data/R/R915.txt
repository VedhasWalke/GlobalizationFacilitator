Very good food and a slightly more upscale restaurant than some of the Indian restaurants in Princeton. We had the samosas (excellent), tikka masala (good), butter chicken (good), mahi tandoor (good), and naan. Also had the house Indian coffee - fantastic! Check was $85 including tip. Will return when I'm in the area.
