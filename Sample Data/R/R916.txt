Don't go here if you have an allergy!  My friend has a gluten allergy and got VERY sick even after she said twice that she needs gluten free.  Moreover, after we were given the check and paid, and I was still sipping my drink, I was told there were people waiting for my table.  We were there barely an hour and were rushed out.  I will not go there again and would not recommend it to anyone, and the food was less than mediocre.  Save your money and go somewhere else!
