A group of us (4 couples), all South Indians went for Lunch buffet yesterday.
The restaurant itself is cozy and clean. The staff very friendly and they aim to please.
Food was good, some very tasty than others. Being a vegetarian, I cannot say anything about the
Non vegetarian dishes.
Fresh hot mini masala dosas brought to the table was great. Rasam was ok as it was just lukewarm. Podi Idilli , chat, pakoras , sambar, chutneys were all good. Beetroot poriyal was mediocre. I did not try the other three vegetarian  dishes as I am not a fan of paneer and all of them were gravy based . It would have been nice to have another dry sabzi instead. I don't eat naan so cannot comment
Yogurt rice  and pickle were very good and as far as dessert goes they had four options. Payasam was good but the sooji halwa was nothing to write home about. There was ice cream and cut up melon too.
Personally, I feel I don't have to eat every dish on the buffet table. I am a happy camper if I find a few dishes that are fresh and flavorful.
I would like to mention how attentive and friendly Mr Sunil was. He went out of his way to make sure we are being taken care of. In my books, great staff is as important as good food and Chennai Chimney gets that.  So, thank you to Mr Sunil and the rest of the staff.
We will be going back for sure.
