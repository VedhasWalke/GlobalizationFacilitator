Went there on a Saturday night.  Took 45 minutes to get warm mediocre lamb dishes.
Bread was not brought out until second course was served, even though we ordered the special bread trio.  Bread also was not hot.
As another review noted, this is not high quality South Indian cuisine.  Way too many items on the menu for them to make all to perfection.
I don't know how people have given this place four and five star reviews.
Best Indian restaurant in Princeton is Cross Culture, but even that is not on a par with the best NYC Indian restaurants.
One positive was the decor.
Was hoping for a great new Indian restaurant in Princeton, but alas, does not hit the mark.
