What a disaster. The owners must look into how much more pathetic can they run restaurant with a terrific menu and location. To start a 30 minute wait inspite if a reservation. Understaffed, with the employees ( max three) running around constantly. Unsatisfied customers complaining to thme first desk while we were waiting. We did put the 30 mins of wait to use by perusing the menu. 5 people in our party got served one after the other. Had to remind the waiters what was pending. The dosa batter was too sour. 2 hrs later after cancelling two items,'asked for a cup a chai and lo and behold cake made with spoilt milk. Overall a total disappointment.
