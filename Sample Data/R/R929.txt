First time at this place! Service was excellent and food was incredible. My family is picky about the authenticity of South Indian food because they are South Indians and this place was on the mark! The Mysore dosa and masala dosa were prepared perfectly. I ordered the Nanjilnadu kozhi chicken curry and it was delicious. All in all this was a very good experience. We will definitely be going back!
