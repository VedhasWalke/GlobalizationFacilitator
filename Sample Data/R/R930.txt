Some of the best Indian food in the area.  Complex flavors with a slow heat - how South Indian food should be. Highly recommend the roasted tomato soup and dal tadka (reminds me of my parents home cooking)!  The desserts were also surprisingly good - try the Halwa - a unique cream of wheat dessert made with ghee.  Attentive service and kid friendly.  Will definitely be back!
