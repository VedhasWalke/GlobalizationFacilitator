Impromptu dinner with the husband on an early Saturday night... I had never experienced Southern Indian cuisine so this was a bit different than other Indian restaurants in our area.Service was friendly and attentive and the food arrived in a very timely manner. We shared everything as our server told us portions were on the "sharable" side. We started with the mushroom appetizer, kaalan manchurian, I believe. If I could have licked that plate and not looked ridiculous, I would have. Absolutely delicious. Next, the potato dosa. Apparently this is much larger than the ones my husband is used to seeing in India. Could have fed four easily. We shared the quail dish for the main course, and as is usually the case, watch out for the tiny bones. Didn't deter us. The flavor and heat level was wonderful. Can't wait to return.
