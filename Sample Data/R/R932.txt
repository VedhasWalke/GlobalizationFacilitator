We went with four teenagers, and everyone cleaned their plates (or banana leaves!) and left happy. We had samosas which were the best ever, and the accompanying chutneys were also great. We ordered aloo masala, lamb rogan josh, chicken tikka with and without the masala sauce, plus 4 kinds of naan. Everything was exceptional. Service was also good, friendly, attentive, and fast. We will definitely return!
