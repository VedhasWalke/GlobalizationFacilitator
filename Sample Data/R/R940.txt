I came for the Saturday buffet at Chennai Chimney. Being in the Princeton NJ area, I expected a full blown flavorful Indian buffet. I've had my share of Indian buffet's so again, maybe I expected to much. The buffet itself was okay, nothing special. I am a vegetarian, and it is vegetarian friendly but there are also a ton of meat items. We went around 1:30 and the buffet closes at 2:30 (strict rules, people were kicking everyone out). I didn't like that as a south Indian buffet, they did not offer dosa items as part of the buffet. Also the north Indian foods, were sub par and nothing special. I expected some paneer dishes or something that would be filling but it was not. The Nan was fresh, but took 10-15 minutes to come to our table and we had to ask the waiters multiple times and they kept giving us attitude. The owner was very friendly and came up to check on us multiple times, which was nice. Not sure if I will be back again.
