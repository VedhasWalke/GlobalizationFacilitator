Docking a star from previous 5-star accolades for Palace of Asia since 2 of my last 3 orders have been inconsistent in food quality and there has been mix ups with the restaurant not reading notes for order specifications such as spice levels and substitutions when included in Uber Eats or Grubhub orders. It seems that food is great some days & lacks attention to detail in preparation on other days. They'll only lose customers with continued inconsistencies as there's fierce competition for Indian food take out & delivery in the area. It's a shame that their excellent longtime servers are not working there anymore, but understandable considering there's virtually no dine in guests when I've gone in to pick up take out orders.
