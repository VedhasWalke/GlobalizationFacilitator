I've been to Palace of Asia mostly for their lunch buffets, and one good thing about it is they've managed to stay consistent with their lunch offerings and the quality/taste. Personally the food is it a bit too bland/sweet to my palate, but overall you won't be disappointed.
I've also been there for dinner and ordered from the menu, the food was okayish but the presentation and the ambience make up for it, and probably they have the best interiors in the area. And if you are ordering drinks they have a full bar with a good variety of liquors and sizzling appetizers to go with!
Give it a shot if you are looking for a meal in a beautiful indian setting!
