Palace of Asia is a spacious restaurant with great ambiance, decor and very good service.  We had dinner here recently on a Monday.  
We ordered the fish pakora, which were outstanding.  It had the right bit of kick and had just been freshly made. For dinner we got the Chicken Makhani and the Palak Paneer.  The Palak Paneer was really great; cooked perfectly with ample amount of paneer in the dish. The rice and naan that we had along with our dinner was also perfect. The Chicken Makhani, however, was not our favorite and left a lot of room to be desired.  Something was just off...the chicken itself was not flavorful, although the gravy was.  It truly seemed like they had pre-cooked chicken and simply threw into the makhani gravy.   The chicken literally had no Indian flavor to it.  
Despite our displeasure with the chicken, Palace of Asia offers good Indian cuisine in a great environment.  We've also had Palace of Asia cater a large event for us. All the items were very tasty and many of our guests commented on how good the food was.
