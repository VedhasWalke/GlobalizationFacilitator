A couple of my Clients in Princeton area had been told me about Palace of Asia and how good their food is and they offered reasonably priced lunch buffet. Since I'm a fan of Indian food I made plans to go for lunch with them on a Friday afternoon.  
Restaurant was a lot larger than I expected with different sections and a large dining area with plenty of seating. Ambience was nice with artistically beautiful deco that brings the India culture right before your eyes, which was very pleasant.
As expected it was very busy during lunch time but we seated immediately we arrived. A server immediately attended to us and took our drink orders.
They had a a wide variety of dishes on buffet which consisted of a wide array of vegetarian dishes and a couple of chicken and meat dishes. I tried some of vegetarian options like Bhindi Masala (some sort of stir fried okra) and Mutter Paneer which I,ve never had before but enjoyed. I also had their Chicken Tikka masala, Spicy Curry Goat , Tandoori Chicken, All in one Pakora( Fried spinach balls)Naan bread and some chutney which were all pretty good.
I was really stuffed after 2 visits to buffet but couldn't resist trying some desert. They had about 3 different desert choices, Fruit Salad with sweet cream and Rice Pudding and Gulab Jumun. I  had Gulab Jamun which is a milky fried ball dipped in warm rose syrup, (Just think of a caky donut ball soaked in sweet flavored syrup.) If you you like sweets like I do, believe me it was outstandingly delicious. I actually had to holdback getting seconds.
Overall I had good experience dining at Palace of Asia. Food quality was pretty good for a buffet, service was on point and for $13 you can't go wrong with their buffet. If you are a fan of Indian food and in the Princeton area try them out. I will definitely stop by again in the near future.
