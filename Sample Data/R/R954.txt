First things first - run away from this place as quickly as you can.
Our experience was not good, we went for a weekday buffet - several items of the buffet were stale, had gone bad and were tasteless.
This place has a large dining area and good decor but does not do any justice to its name of  Palace or Asia in terms of satisfying tastebuds of customers.
