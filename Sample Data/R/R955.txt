Mixed feelings about this place. I used to enjoy it but I've visited four times in the last six months and only ate once. Two visits I could not find a parking spot. Next one I was in a hurry and needed to get something for take out. Buffet was up and running and all I wanted was one small bowl of goat. I didn't want to browse the menu and wait for someone to cook something that I could get off the buffet. Server had to escalate my request to the pudwhack manager who said "I must charge full price!" I said OK, just give me a take out container and the check. 10 more minutes wasted waiting for him to return so I left and had no time left to make other arrangements.
Pro tip: let the wait staff make the decisions involving $1 risks. I used to take groups of 3-4 here on a regular basis but it's just not worth the hassle any more.
