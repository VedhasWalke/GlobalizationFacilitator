I was getting together with some friends and they wanted to get Indian food. The only two times I've gotten Indian food I didn't care for it so I was skeptical.
When we got to Palace of Asia they had a buffet available which we all got. There was quite a variety of foods, and I especially liked the fried vegetables and the cheesy spinach. Pretty much everything on my plate was something I've never tried before in my life so it was quite an experience. Whether I was a fan of the flavor for each dish or not, the quality was definitely good. Also, pretty much everything except for about 4 chicken dishes was vegetarian. For dessert they had rice pudding which was good and some little donut-like things which were also good. And most surprising of all, the bill only came out to about $13 per person.
