A yelp find after a local winery visit. We were pleasantly surprised as we walked into the place. The place is decorated in a very aesthetically pleasant way. As you walk in, there is a small banquet room with a pretty chandelier, welcoming the patrons. The main dining hall has a warm feel with a fireplace. The service was great and welcoming. We were all in a vegetarian mood so the items selected are primarily vegetarian. The only down side was that we asked for the food to be spicy but it was average spice levels.
Appetizer:
Paneer Tikka - came out sizzling with the right spices and a lemon to squeeze on top.
Hariyali kabab / Spinach balls - made with spinach and potatoes and deep fried. Pretty tasty option.
All appetizers were served with this yogurt, mint, green chili sauce which was pretty good spicy condiment. Also came with a sweet tamarind date chutney that was pretty good too.
Entrees:
Navratran korma - very rich and creamy curry with tons of vegetables.
Malai kofta -
Chana masala - this was spicy and flavorful. The spices we're balanced by the tomatoes in the sauce and went very well with poori.
Lamb seekh kabab - pretty tasty and came on a sizzling platter. Could've used some spice
Bread basket - comes with a fluffy poori, plain naan, onion kulcha, chapati. Always a good one to order and it complimented the entrees very well.
The entrees came with rice.
We also wanted to try their specialty drinks menu. The ginger sparkler was a bit disappointing as it lacked the ginger punch.
Goa kokum breeze was sweet and almost no alcohol.
Ginger mango Martini was good.
If I'm in the area, I'd revisit.
