Food here is delicious!  My friend and I order takeout here to celebrate our birthdays.  We love the tikka Masala and Murg Makani.  The flavor of the yogurt sauces are perfect but I wish they were a little less watery, the mango lassi is very tasty but I wish they had options to buy 16 or 24 oz servings not just 10 oz. Otherwise we love this upscale Indian cuisine in a great neighborhood and the prices are average about 57 dollars for 2 dishes, naan, rice and one lassi.
