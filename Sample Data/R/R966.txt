Can't believe I haven't been here sooner!
- Location is in a strip mall, however- once inside, you wouldn't realize it
- Atmosphere is very nice
- They have a liquor license (which is one the few Indian restaurants in the area that do)
- Service was ok, but my expectations weren't that high either
- Food quality was excellent
Yes, one of the better Indian restaurants in Mercer County....give it a shot!
