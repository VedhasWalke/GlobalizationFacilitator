This place is good.  Popped in for a buffett lunch on a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon.  I was flanked by my wife, toddler and infant and we were impressed.
It was busy, but not packed...so there was pretty good turnover filling to dishes.  The staff was attentive and the location was clean.  Most importantly, there was lots of tasty options at an affordable price.  I will be back.
