Came here for Mother's Day lunch buffet and it was terrible. We usually go to Chand Palace every year but decided to change it up (bad idea, never again will we betray Chand Palace!). We have had an excellent experience here in the past for a dinner party in their private dining room, but it's safe to say we will not be returning for their lunch buffet.
First off, they only had 3 appetizers - aloo papri chaat which tasted rotten, "chutney" sandwiches which were nothing but dry white bread with some butter, and mini uttapam which were somewhat edible. The chutneys were fluorescent colors (the mint chutney literally looked like toothpaste, see picture below). None of the food seemed appetizing at all. Very little vegetarian dishes besides mattar paneer which was so watery, basically like rasam with some peas and paneer cubes, navratan korma which was equally bad, and dal makhani which was okay. A staple of any good Indian restaurant is the naan - here, it tasted like frozen naan that was microwaved. We ended up eating some rice, dal, and raita and left hungry and disappointed! The only good dish was the ras gulas for dessert. The ambiance is very nice and spacious for big groups (especially our obnoxious family of 13) but be warned, DO NOT come here if you're looking for a good Indian lunch buffet as it lacks both quantity and quality of food items.
