I didn't go there for the lunch buffet so my review is solely based on the dishes we ordered during dinner time.  
I wasn't impressed with the chicken Marsala there, this is usually my favorite Indian dish and I always order it.  While the sauce was tasty but the chicken itself was dry and tasted "old", like it's frozen chicken or something with preservatives, it just didn't taste fresh.  And the dish was $16.95 and portion was small.  I've had better tasting chicken Marsala with bigger portion for cheaper price.  
We also orders a potato and eggplant dish, it was so bland that I asked them to take back and put some sauce or spice in it.  It came back being the same flavor- bland, but they put some cilantro on top as decoration.  I didn't bother to complain again and just mixed it with the chicken Marsala sauce.  
2 stars for the ambiance and decor of this place.  It almostfeel like you are in a "palace".
