This is the best Indian restaurant. The customer service is always terrific. Anil (server & bartender) and Tirkit (Manager) always make us feel like we've come home. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated.
Tonight, we got take out. Navaratan (sp?) Korma, Chicken Mahkani (sp?), garlic naan, and masala tea. These are two of our favorites (as well as Palak Paneer).  Navaratan Korma is just the most amazing creation, but tonight the Navaratan Korma was beyond amazing!!! I highly recommend this place to everyone that likes Indian food! Don't miss out on this gem of a place.
