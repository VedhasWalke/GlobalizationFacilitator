Over the years many Indian restaurants have opened in Princeton, NJ. Yet very few can boast the consistency in food quality like Palace. I have been visiting this place for at least 5 years now. The decor at Palace of Asia is just gorgeous inside, and was a complete surprise upon entering. It is HUGE inside from what it looks like on the outside. You'd never guess that such a bland exterior in a strip mall could open up to such a beautiful interior.  A nice selection of dishes, both meat and vegetarian in a variety of sauces an plenty of rice and naan. The staff is very friendly and the decor is very nice. When I've family and friends over in town who want to try Indian food. this is where I take them. The price is reasonable. Our favorites are Kashmiri Dum Aloo and Paneer Makhani. For those who just want to sample Indian Cuisine I would recommend the afternoon buffet.
Personally, we've never had a disappointing experience at Palace of Asia. Among the 5-6 Indian restaurants in the Princeton/Lawrenceville area, this ranks as one of the best.
