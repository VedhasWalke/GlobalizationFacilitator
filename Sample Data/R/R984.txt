I did a reservation early afternoon for 16 people and requested that we get a round table and the host suggested that I get long rectangle table since it would be an ideal situation. When we got to the place they didn't even have me on the list and then they started looking for place to sit the party of 16 and ended us putting on 3 separate tables ( this is a family dinner for mother's day).
