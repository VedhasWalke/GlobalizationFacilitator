We dine here once a month and had very good service and food.  Somethings has happen we were left at table while others that came in 10 minutes after us had service and there order was taken while we sat there waiting.
Not very good for repeat customers.  Service had been less than stellar coming up to this incident but food was good enough to let this slide.  
We left and maybe never coming back.
