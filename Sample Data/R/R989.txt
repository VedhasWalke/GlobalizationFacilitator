This is one of the few restaurants I travel to get to because it's so worth it.
I love their food.  Their Navratan Korma is by far the best I've ever had and their tandoori chicken is the only tandoori chicken I'll even consider eating.
The restaurant is in this weird strip mall a few miles past the Quakerbridge Mall, but the inside is quite beautiful, the staff is friendly and helpful and the food is the best Indian food I've ever had.
Even their buffet is excellent.  As one who usually bypasses buffet food and orders off the menu, even when a buffet is open, I will always do the buffet at Palace of Asia because it's excellent quality food and a fantastic selection.
