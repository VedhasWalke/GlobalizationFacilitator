We have been going to Palace of Asia ever since it opened up in Lawrenceville.  Their food is consistently great.  Very recently I took some business clients to their restaurant and they were extra nice   We got a buffet and they actually brought out fresh roti cause they did not want to eat naan and paratha.  In this time and age it is easier to get good food but very difficult to get good service.
