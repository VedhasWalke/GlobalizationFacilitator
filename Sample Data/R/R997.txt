We just moved here and were looking to start our Indian Food tour since our family are such big fans.  Since we are new, I went to a local FB page to get the general consensus of which is the best Indian restaurant around Robbinsville.  The majority of the responses sent me here.
   The inside of the restaurant is very nice.  It is much nicer than the standard strip mall Indian joint.  The restaurant was not crowded and we were sat promptly.  The service was slower than i would have expected, but the server was very nice and courteous.
    Now for the food.  It was incredibly average.  The Tandoori chicken was bland.  Five small pieces, not worth the $$.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was definitely the highlight.  My Rogan Josh had 7 pieces of lamb total.  The Naan was small and not as fluffy and hot as I am used to.  We did have one desert, a Mango Lassi and a Taj Mahal Beer.  Total cost with tip was $100.  
It wasn't bad, but for all the references I was definitely expecting better.  We look forward to trying the next local spot.
