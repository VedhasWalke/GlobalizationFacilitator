If it is possible to give 0 stars that's what Palace of asia would deserve in my opinion.
The Paneer in the buffet tasted like rubber and was sour as if it was spoiled. I had once ordered take out for Samosas and Pakoras. Reheated them in my oven and  found a pool of green colored oil on the foil paper underneath. Very unappealing!
One of my close friend's boyfriend worked here as a waiter and he said that everything is cooked on Sunday and used all through out the week.
There are much better Indian restaurants in terms of food standards in comparison to this restaurant. Would suggest to go to Chand Palace or crown of india for a better experience.
