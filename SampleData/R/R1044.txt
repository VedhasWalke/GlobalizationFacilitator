Very good Indian with an extremely clean and pretty interior.
I enjoyed my food, and the servers are pleasant.  I found their knowledge levels a little spotty, as one admitted to not having tried either of the dishes about which I was debating which should be standards.
Anyway, the interior is large and very clean.  It's somewhat strange being in a strip mall, and then you enter this faux swanky Indian restaurant.  I say faux because we're still talking about a $15 meal; it's not fancy, but they up the ante as much as they can.
Rice is good, sauces are flavorful and the menu is varied.  They cover all the core bases.  The ominous point is that they include some flat-out American fair, such as Chicken Fingers which is ridiculous.  They may be trying to please TOO many people.
I really enjoyed the eggplant, and the vegetable jalfrezi is not something you'll find too often.
