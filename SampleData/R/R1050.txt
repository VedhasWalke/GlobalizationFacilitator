I honestly don't know if they deserve 5 stars, but I cannot really think of a major complaint right now so to knock off a star arbitrarily seems unfair, especially they do so much right. However, I will leave the caveat that Palace of Asia really isn't the "OMG MUST GO" kind of 5 stars
i think their lunch buffet is the best indian lunch buffet in the area too
I don't fancy myself as an expert in indian food, but I will say that it is almost all good- the vindaloo here is really good. really good vegetarian options too; try their paneer which is like milk curds. awesome.
however, I think that their 'tandoori grill' options are somewhat less good than most of their curry dishes - unremarkable, pricier and drier
