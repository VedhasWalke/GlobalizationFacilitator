We've enjoyed their food for quite a long time. It's quite beautiful inside, quiet and relaxed although it does get a bit loud at dinner, but what restaurant doesn't? If you go at off hours, it's as tranquil as can be.
I've got my favorite dishes in general, usually palak paneer (saag paneer); tikka masala, bhindi masala, and navratan korma. I'm in no way a vegetarian however, and they do a wonderful "mixed grill" appetizer which includes delicious seekh kabobs and other tasty morsels. Tandoori chicken is my companions favorite (personally, I've always found it a bit dry no matter who makes it) Favorite appetizers include aloo tikki and harabhara kebab, and I'm partial to paratha bread. Desserts include gulab jamun, which are so sweet they could put anyone in a sugar coma, but heck, why not?
Several months back, we had dinner on what must have been a Sunday or Monday - aka the chef's night off - and were served one dish that was so floating in grease it looked like grease soup. That turned us off completely, and we didn't go back for a year. That was the exception, the one time things went wrong.
We went back over the weekend for the lunch buffet and thoroughly enjoyed it. (Except for the rude customers who let their kids run screaming and jumping on the banquettes). Good selection of choices - tandoori chicken; tikka masala, a vegetable entree (bhindi masala, a favorite); a lamb selection, a paneer dish, chickpea dish; navratan korma, as well as an appetizer, bread, rice, accompaniements, dessert selection.
All these years I have yet to try the other local Princeton area places (Mehek, Masala Grill, Tandoori Bite) which all seem to have gotten thoroughly mixed reviews, but heck we like the food here, so we'll stick with it.
