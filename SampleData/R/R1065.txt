Very nice addition to the local area!  
I did take outs for small groups on 2 occasions and was very pleased both times.
The fried rice and biryani offerings are very good and fairly generous sized.  The kebabs and appetizers and afghani chicken and salami chicken entrees were excellent.
Wish they had a slightly nicer sit down option.  But if take out (or doordash) works for you then this is one of the better options in the general area.
