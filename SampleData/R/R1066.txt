I eat from here almost every week and their food is so great. Their biryani is definitely probably the best in this area and the prices are fair. I usually also get the chicken tikka masala and I have found that it tastes better if you get it spicy. The spice isn't too bad to handle and elevated the dish. Overall great experience with this restaurant.
