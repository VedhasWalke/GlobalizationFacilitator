Truly a hidden gem in the South Brunswick area. After having heard rave reviews about the place from locals, we decided to give it a try this afternoon. The wife and I opted for the Veg and Chicken thalis, and we loved it! Specially recommend the Chicken thali - came with decent portions of a Chilli Shrimp appetizer, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Chettinad, Dal, Chicken Biryani + raita, Naan and dessert.
Definitely recommending this to our friends in the area, and will come back again. This place needs to be more popular!
