This place used to be my favorites in 2010 time. It was so authentic. Between 2014-2017 , quality came down :(  
I went there in February and Bang- they are back . Fantastic food now ..  loved everything except the wait times ...
Parotta with kurma was just excellent!! Chicken fry biryani was outstanding ... loved the soup . We also ordered pepper chicken and it was so good.
Food quality was superlative overall. Will go again for sure ..
