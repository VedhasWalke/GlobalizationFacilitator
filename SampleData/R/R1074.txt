We have always carried out from this place. Thought we would go in and eat this time. Not the place to go, for ambience and service, but the food was good. Good biryanis (mutton and chicken) and for appetizers we had tandoori pomfret and chicken 65 which were good.
Place seems really popular for carry out.
