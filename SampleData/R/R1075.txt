We decided to try this restaurant as we are from the area and had never been here before.
This was our first time eating here- we ordered king fish curry with 2 chapatis and onion chili dosa. The fish curry was the worst fish curry that I ever had- not sure if they don't know how to make it...also fish was falling apart- did not look fresh. When we questioned the hostess, she refused to admit that it was not fresh or to take it back. The Chapati was crunchy- which I asked for them to replace. The dosa and sambhar was standard/good.
I believe the rule of thumb to follow in this place- stick with only foods that you know are authentic South Indian such as idli, dosa etc - and to not venture into trying non vegetarian foods.
