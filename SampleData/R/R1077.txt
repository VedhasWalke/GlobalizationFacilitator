I have been a customer of this year by year deteriorating restaurant for years.I have seen its quality take a nose dive from its peak.
Recently during a visit with family (I stay quite close to Anjappar (North Brunswick)) things reached a boiling point and i lost all patience as the guys running this restaurant straight out to save money took things to a whole different level.
We were 6 of us and arrived at 8:45pm and the moment we entered the first thing that greeted us was the stuffiness and stink.Everyone was sweating but since my uncle wanted to try some spicy food i brought him here.
We immediately noticed that most of the buffet was not refilled and we thought like any good hotel more food was on the way or so we thot.What followed was the worst dining experience of our lives.Even after polietly asking the staff to get more food they blatantly said they can only do so much and in a restaurant that was in full capacity mentioned they don't want to waste food.I politely told them they were charging us $16 per plate for a buffet and we barely had the opportunity to taste 5-6 items.The staff guy got angry and said its not his problem so i asked him in order to increase their profits they were ready to put the customers experience on the line and swindle him by saying food will go wasted.The older lady at the desk instead of apologizing mentioned its a loss for them.I told them that they shudnt be talking this way or putting customers in such situations where to earn a few dollars in profit they take customers for granted.
I think as indians too we tend to go along and thats why restaurants such as these take us for granted with their cheap mentality.It is important these guys learn their lessons and shud take a leaf out of their other franchisee Anjappar -Princeton (i truly value good service) in hospitality, service and hygiene.
By the way it was so hot and stuffy inside we were in and out of the restaurant in 30 mins and our damage $110.
Hopefully as business decreases these guys will learn their lesson.
