If you want good Indian food, especially south Indian, this is the place for you! Whether its with friends or family, it has an accommodating atmosphere and very well decorated with ample space.
I came here multiple times and was never disappointed. The first time we got pepper chicken, chicken lollipops and chicken biryani all of which were great, my favorite were the lollipops - very crispy and spicy but not too much. The second time I got the chicken thaali. Every time the portions were great and quite filling. We had to take some back both times. I also had their masala chai and lassi which were quite good too. My friends had all tried the dosas which they also loved.
I'd highly recommend this place for your Indian fix!
