I've been here 3 times by far, every time for dinner. This is one place you can count on not to disappoint you on food quality.
Yes, there have been times when the servers were a bit stiff or they had run out of some dishes/breads we wanted to order. But I will let that pass, for multiple reasons, one is their crab masala, 2nd is their chicken and mutton dishes (mutton sukka varuval and chicken chettinad are very good, feel at home) and 3rd is their madras coffee. I did not like the sambar at all though (in terms of authentic taste), they need to work on that. Parking is available and the ambience is nice.
