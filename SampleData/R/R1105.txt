I'm not a specialist on Indian food... I've only had it a handful of times, but I enjoyed the lunch buffet here and was happy with most of the dishes (soup was a bit too salty).
We were pleased to see that this place had a weekday lunch buffet, whereas many other Indian restaurants in the area only offer lunch buffet on the weekends.
