I just love this place. Found this place by accident when my GPS went crazy. But probably the best south indian food that you can find in jersey area. The biriyani is so well cooked with the meat soft enough to fall if the bones. The thali is my husband's all time favorite with a pretty good portion. We end up sharing most of the time. The parota is super just like what you get back home. Chicken lollipop a must try. Prawn 65 small portion but crispy. We tried the pepper chicken which was ok but very small portion.
Obviously the anjappar restaurants in india are a little better. They serve food on banana leaves and that adds to the flavor. A must try place for somebody who craves good south indian food.
