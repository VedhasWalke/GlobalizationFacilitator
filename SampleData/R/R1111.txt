I brought my family here who were visiting from FL. And it was the worst decision of my life. The waiters were horrible. I see that may be they were over worked. But, that is NO reason to treat the customers bad. We pay for our food don't we? So, don't treat us like shit.
Dear Management, fix the employees situation, or you will fall out of favor. Really soon. Please don't ruin a reputation you gained by decades of hard work.
