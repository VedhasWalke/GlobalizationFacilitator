Mediocre food. We have ordered from the lunch specials, as well as from the dinner menu. What stands out is the cool Chettinad decor. They have taken good effort to recreate that.
Food wise, I have had better. Sometimes the Sambhar and chutneys are so bad, we wonder why we keep coming back. We do because we have very few choices left.
Good menu items: Kuzhi Paniaram, Paneer Tikka Masala
