My rating is based exclusively on the food.. There was nothing about the ambience or service worth describing here!
We loved the Chettinad flavors! The parota was perfect and we enjoyed each bite with scrumptious Chettinad chicken masala. The chicken biriyani was superb, the chicken was quite tender and juicy! We also had the chicken 65, it was ok...
Revisiting soon...
