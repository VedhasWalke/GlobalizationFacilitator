This review is really one that if I could have, I would have given three and a half stars. The good here is really good. Having eaten authentic chettinad cuisine in India itself, I was very pleased. I ordered the vegetable kothu paratha which was spicy enough to make me drink quite a few glasses of water. My uncle got the egg kothu Maratha which was very mild spice wise but still delicious and filling, and my cousin got the chicken lollipops which he completely demolished before any of us could turn around. Two appetizers you absolutely must try are the paneer and the fried (I think?) cauliflower. Absolutely delicious. I could have snacked on then the entire meal and still been satisfied by the end of the night.
My only complaint was the service. It was slow at times and often I had to get up to find the waiter/waitress to take out order. They also left us pitchers of water that were not frequently filled or replaced, which may have contributed to the hyper spice that I remember. In addition, chettinad cuisine also had less vegetarian options and it just so happened that a lot of the veggie food we wanted was not available.
There's another location in nyc which is closer to me so maybe I'll check that one out to see if they're any different.
