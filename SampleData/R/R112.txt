A most pleasant surprise.  I haven't been here in many years and only came at the invitation of some old friends.  The change of ownership, management, philosophy and menu moved this from a place that I'd only go upon invitation to a place that I'd go as a destination.  The food was very good, the service - very professional and the friendliness of the owners - exceptional.  The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 was that the portions of the entrees were satisfactory, but not exceptional.   For an excellent meal with good prices and warm, friendly service, this is a new destination restaurant for us!
