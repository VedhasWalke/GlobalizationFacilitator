Wow! This place is delicious, and actually serves authentic south Indian food. I usually don't post on here, but this place did deserve it. Their shrimp biryani is spicy and really good. We got gulab jamun for dessert, which wasn't dry like most other places around here. Overall, really enjoyed this place and will come back!
