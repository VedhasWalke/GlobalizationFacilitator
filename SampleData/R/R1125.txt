Awesome food. Our go to place for Chettinad food. The número uno is their Crab Masala special. A huge crab which needs at least two people to do justice in a spicy gravy had either with parotta or plain steamed rice. A close second are sukka mutton varuaval (dry mutton), biriyani and shrimp 65.
All washed down by Masala tea. The only improvement would be on the service side. At peak times they struggle.
