I was reluctant to dine at this place after seeing 3.1 stars for the restaurant. But to my surprise, I felt the Authentic chettinad taste. Had vegetarian Biriyani and Kal dosa. Biriyani was served hot and spiciness was apt and I could enjoy the flavor and taste. It was more like a home made Biriyani with the right amount of spices and spiciness. Kal dosa was equally good. Wait time for the orders were less and I got both my items exactly in less than 15 min after I placed my order. I felt t same taste I experienced in Chennai. Only one con about this place is quantity was less and bit expensive.
