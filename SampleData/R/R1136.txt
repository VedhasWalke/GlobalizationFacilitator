Good food, bad service.
Plain parotta with veg kuruma & raitha - This was the best dish on the table. Perfectly flavored kuruma and refreshing raitha. I'll go back for this, inspite of the poor service
Rasam - one of the best I've had. Strong flavor of asafetida. And that's why I liked it. But for those who don't like this Indian spice, stay away from this rasam
Dosas - were ok. Nothing special
Appam - we went all the way to this place to have appams as we had heard good things about it. But unfortunately they didn't have it that day. It was Sunday afternoon and they didn't have one of their main dishes! Quite disappointing.
Service - there was only 1 person who was taking orders at most tables. He was clearly quite harrowed and curt because we were a large group. They need to add more staff.
