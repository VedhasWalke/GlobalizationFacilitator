Earlier today,  5/12/15, I ordered Egg Uthappam. A few minutes into eating, something rubbery got into my mouth. I took it out of my mouth, placed in on the plate and called the Nepali fellow who had taken my order (he was in charge of the restaurant at that time) and asked him what was that. He said mutton. He had served me Egg-Mutton Uthapam!!
I was totally pissed since I do not eat meat and here was this stupid idiot who did not pay attention to what I asked for and ruined my dinner, my appetite and my evening. I was the only cutomer at that time and this moron with his rustic English is not even competent to take one order correctly.
The owner of the restaurant needs to take serious cognizance of this and make sure that illegals and persons who are not focused on customer service and customer satisfaction are not made in charge of the restaurant in his absence.
