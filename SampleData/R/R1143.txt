My husband and I were looking for a new Indian place to eat. When we arrived we were the only patrons. The waiter was helpful and we actually let him pick our two chicken entrees. He initially suggested butter chicken and chicken tikka....boring but probably a safe recommendation for non Indian patrons. We went with two chicken curry dishes, vegetable samosa, a dosa and an order of butter naan. The samosa was outstanding and the sauces for the dosa were also great. The curry dishes were good, not great. Would try this place again...maybe the korma next time.
