Very bad customer service .. Stopped in for lunch on a weekend .. I basically had to call the waiter out each time I wanted to order.. Nobody filled water in my glass. Nobody laid out plates on my table. I'm okay with that at a fast food joint . But if you charge premium money , I expect a certain level of service . Food is good though
