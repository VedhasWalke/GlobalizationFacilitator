Compared to what I had heard about this place, it was rather ordinary. Went for lunch and were asked to join the Buffet. The buffet was not only south indian. It had much of mixed north indian cousins. Not that I have anything against north indian cousine, but we went there specifically for south indian food. No dosa of any kind in the buffet options. Lots of meet options, with north indian flavors. They were not bad, but nothing to write home about.
