I had heard about the food here being really good.
The service sucks big time. The waiters have no idea what is going on, and are completely uncommunicative. Half the stuff on the menu was not available.From whatever was available, food was served 45 minutes to 1 hour after the order was given. The waiters did not have the courtesy to serve water during the wait. They showed loads of attitude, as though they were doing us a favor by serving us. The food was good, but for the price we paid and for the excruciatingly long wait, Ive had much better food elsewhere. At the end of it all, while paying the bill, one of us commented that the service is poor, and the response was haughty...such that complaints of this nature were very usual to the staff, and they dont seem interested in making amends. They have a 'Take it or leave it' attitude, which, according to me is not very inviting.
I am not going to go there again, so they have lost at least one customer for good. I recommend this place, only if all other options are exhausted, and you have a lot of time on your hands, and definitely if there are no kids in your group.
