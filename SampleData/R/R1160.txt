Been there for a take out despite my previous experience. Seeing all the 4/5 star reviews, I thought they improved their food & service quality. Alas! I was wrong. I rather give them 0 stars for what they did during this trip. Very disappointing for such a well rated Indian Chain Restaurant! I will never ever go there again. The ladies working at the restaurant can verify my agony!!!
Anyway, called and ordered 13 items: Kathirikai kulambu, paniyaram, prawn fry, crab curry, chicken roast, pepper chicken, paratha, ceylon paratha, egg kothu paratha, mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani, chicken 65, mutton bone soup. Got only 10 items. Missed prawn fry, egg kothu paratha and mutton bone soup!!! Anyway, we did not know until we unpacked and started eating. We were a group of 9ppl with 4 (incl 3 kids) egg-tarians & 5 NV-tarians. A party at my place gone so crazy that we did not have enough food for all!
On top of all this, they did not give me my receipt. When I went back to tell the 2 ladies who were taking care of the restaurant that evening, they told me that they received the order and prepared as is and that I DID NOT ORDER ANY MORE. When I called them regarding the receipt first, they read all the items that I ordered to make sure they're talking to the right person. When I appear in person, they told me that I did not order more than those 10 items. How in the world they change what they say in about 1 hr' time frame!
We all went home hungry soon after. My agony is that THE KIDS DID NOT GET TO EAT ENOUGH. I arranged for the party and now, its all my fault.
