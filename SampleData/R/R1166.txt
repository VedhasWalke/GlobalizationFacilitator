I ordered the vegetarian meal (with all the little dishes).  The food was very flavorful and spicy.  I really liked it.  It was much better than anything I've had in Manhattan.  I loved the fact that there were so many dishes to try.  I'm not used to eating so spicy so my mouth was burning but as my friend put it, "you know it's good when you keep eating even though your mouth is burning and you can't feel anything."
