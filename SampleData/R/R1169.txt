Food was quite good but the restaurant cleanliness and service needs a lot of working on... Silverware provided was not clean, tables where not cleaned up after we ate and in general service was not professional.
A lot of the items in the menu was not available not sure if it was the time of the day or something else ... Was looking forward to having appam but it was not available.
In general was disappointment with the restaurant but the items I ordered was good no qualms on that front..
