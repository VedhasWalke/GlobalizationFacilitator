Great place for weekend lunch. Authentic South Indian and Chettinad restaurant.
4 of us went for lunch. Go before noon to be seated peacefully. The ordered dishes came pretty quick. But as the place fills up naturally the turnaround time was bad.
Food:
Chicken 65 - awesome
Poondu Kuzhambu - THE most authentic. Claimed to be the best ever.
Veg Kothu Parotta - Excellent!
Keema parotta - Super tasty and very filling
Ambiance & Seating:
Bit noisy and congested. As suggested earlier, go before noon for a little peace.
Price: Good and worth for the food
Verdict: Having moved to CA miss the food.
