Discovered this restaurant on yelp. Had no idea what to expect from south Indian cuisine. The waiter helped us order Chicken 65 and a cauliflower appetizer. Then goat meat and parotta entree. He helped us understand how to eat it properly. Everything was wonderful!
The appetizers were mild and very flavorful, fried without being greasy or heavy. The goats meat was very spicy but super flavorful at the same time. The parotta was fantastic, ordered a second serving. The waiter sent out a warm milk and tapioca dessert on the house. Everyone was so nice and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. We'll go back again and again!
