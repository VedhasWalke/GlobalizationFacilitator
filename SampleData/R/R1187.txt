We love Anjappar food due to its authencity, esp the Biryani. However, the reason for the 3/5 stars is 2-fold. 1) It is unbelievable that even steamed rice is considered as a paid side order. The small, thin, plain rotis cost $2.00 each. I think this is ridiculous. An appetizer with 2 entrees can easily run over $50 and this does not include tip. To add further to the expense, there are hardly any leftovers to take back home. The portion size is indeed disappointing. For this money, at any other comparable restaurant, you can easily make an additional meal for two. 2) The ambience or the service is not great either. It is hard to get the servers' attention even during the non-rush hour. I understand that they prepare authentic dishes, but the basal spice level is too high (as is I have a high spice threshold). Even 24 hrs after consuming this food, my stomach feels the sting. I must add that the staff and the person responsible for billing have a general attitude of doing their patrons a big favor. A restaurant has to do a lot more than just serving good food. I would recommend to focus more on patron satisfaction than the huge profit margin.
