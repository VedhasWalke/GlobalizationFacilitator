This is the find of the month for me! I loved the authentic Chettinad taste this place has preserved. We had a Crab Masala which was a large dish with a whole crab. Though it was a bit messy to eat it was amazingly delicious, per my Mom, wife and dad. :) I had the chicken masala. Their parathas are out of this world! We have been to this place couple of times already after our first visit. I have to side with some of the other reviewers regarding service. The waiters are not immaculate but for authentic food like this, it is a compromise well worth it. I would recommend take out if you are finicky about service.
