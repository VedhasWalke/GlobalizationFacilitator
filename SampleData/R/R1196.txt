This is a hidden gem and I hope it stays that way. My parents discovered Palace of Asia and have consistently raved about this place for 4+ years now. In our household, it holds the high honor of Most Consistent and Delicious Lunch Buffet in the Area*.  (Note that we have only been here for the lunch buffet, so I can't comment on the quality or service for other occasions.)
This is all to say that Palace of Asia is still in its strong honeymoon phase of excellent quality, fantastic and kind service, delicious food, and reliability. We love the goat/lamb, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken; I love the veggie biryani, saag paneer (chopped spinach with paneer cheese cubes), kheer (rice pudding and not that sweet all!). We always have a wonderful time here at lunch and walk away so satisfied.
The service is kind, courteous, and professional. It also seems like this venue has the space for large events (fancy receptions, company dinners...). I would love to be a fly on the wall for those happenings.
Keep it up Palace of Asia! As far as I'm concerned, you have the record for the Most Consistent and Delicious Lunch Buffet Anywhere.
*Since 2005, we've lived through a steady stream of Asian Buffet grand openings in the neighborhood (within a 40 min drive from 08550), firsthand experienced the plummeting quality of once very promising restaurants, sulked at rising prices, and waved goodbye to those very same buffets as they went out of business. Palace of Asia seems like a keeper.
