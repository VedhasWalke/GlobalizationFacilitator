I'm not sure how this place has great reviews but maybe during COVID times the quality has dropped.  The is place is, by far, the worst Indian food I have had in the area.  I'm not even sure how they managed it but the chicken vindaloo was bland and not spicy, the samosas were very plain and the mint sauce literally tasted like water.  Do yourself a favor and just go to Guru Palace instead.
