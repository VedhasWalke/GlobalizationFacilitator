Came here for lunch buffet! There are a lot of options, including three meat dishes (tandoori chicken, chicken cashmere and a lamb curry), and a lot of vegetable dishes, naan and rice. There's also some hummus and pita, salad/cold dishes, and desserts. A lot of the options are somewhat spicy, in a way that you kind of don't notice as you're eating it but gradually builds up in your mouth and eventually it feels quite spicy. I definitely ate too much and I really enjoyed the dishes I tried (mostly the ones with meat haha and a bite of the vegetable options as well).
