Wow! First time there today. Have been to many others in the area over the past 7+ years and by far this is the best. The selection on the buffet was excellent. The paneer, perfect. The lamb and chicken dishes were out. I am typically wary of fried because of old oil, but here the fried items were light and not greasy and did not taste of old oil! Only thing that I think can be improved is to serve the naan per table, hot and buttered. It loses something on the steam table. Overall great job!
