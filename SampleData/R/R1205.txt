We were craving Indian food and decided to try Palace of Asia and were so impressed with the food!  Everything was delicious from the Samosa to the Naan to the vegan entrees to the dessert. Our experience was so wonderful that we ordered their food again a few days later. Can't wait til restaurants are again open for dining so we can eat in their dining room!
