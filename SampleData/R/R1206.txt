My experience here was below average for a central NJ Indian restaurant. Lots of space here as there is a main dining area, a sports bar, a separate side bar, and at least 2 event rooms from what I could see. The entrance by the parking lot still has Christmas lights up and a happy holidays sign, which I found odd considering it's March. The atmosphere left something to be desired in the restaurant area as there were 2 events going on, with very little soundproofing. There was an obnoxiously loud DJ trying to get guests pumped up for a child's first birthday party in one of the event rooms, and the sound could be heard throughout the restaurant. I've never heard someone get so loud to rile up people at a 1st birthday party, but I guess to each their own for how extremely they get to celebrate their child's birthday. I would think the birthday boy/girl would get annoyed at such a young age. The waiter could not honor a request for an appetizer to be made a certain way, so we wound up skipping appetizers. Both the chicken and paneer dishes ordered were decent with great presentation, but merely average in flavor and spice. The naan was fresh, but there was nothing particularly memorable about the food here. If not for the loud events going on ruining the atmosphere I would have probably rated this 2.5-3 stars, but the overall experience won't have me rushing to dine here again soon given other options in the area, especially considering dishes here are more pricey than other places in the area. This location very much pales in comparison to their original Lawrenceville location at which I've had consistently good meals & service.
