This is my first experience of this restaurant. How wonderful, to be able to try so many Indian dishes, prepared so well! I wasn't able to adhere to my Whole Food Plant Based (oil free)way of eating, except to avoid meat... but as an (infrequent!) treat, this was delightful. A lassi drink helped dispel some of the lingering spicy heat of a few dishes.
