The Palace of Asia is the best Indian restaurant we have in New Jersey. I've been here a handful of times and always left with a pleasant experience. The food is absolutely delicious, fresh, and of a large variety - all your favorite Indian dishes. From appetizers, to rice and noodles, to naans, to entrees, and finally to desserts, this place has it all. I highly recommend trying their lunch buffet specials. For slightly over $10, you can get a taste of the entire subcontinent. The dinner rates are not as worthy since it's more money for less food. This location is enormous and I believe a popular wedding location. The wait staff is knowledgeable about all their dishes, refills your water quickly, and great at what they do. Do be sure to give them a try. Blessings!
