This place is vastly overrated. Service was well below average with the server doing the bare minimum. I asked for an order of onion pakoras & the server told me they couldn't be made, but I could get the vegetable pakoras. Last I checked, onion pakoras were part of the assortment of the vegetable pakoras...I always ordered just the onion ones at the original Lawrenceville location. Since the waiter declined my initial appetizer selection, I ordered the chicken pakoras. The downside is that they wound up coming out after one of the main meals. The restaurant doesn't know how to pace meals if a main course comes before the appetizer. To top things off, the waiter totally forgot about the drink I ordered when I arrived, so that eventually came along about 15 minutes later after me reminding him. I ordered my chicken dish with medium spiciness, but it came out bland & tasteless. When the check came, the receipt read that my dish was entered as mild, so I know that attention to detail is not a strong suit at this restaurant. For the prices being the highest in the area, there are many better alternatives than Palace of Asia. It came out to be a very expensive & unmemorable meal.
