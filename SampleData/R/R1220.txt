Vatan's East Windsor location just opened today; we were one of the first customers to place an order. Note that they currently do not have online ordering set up so they are only taking orders via phone. As of Day 1 they did not have their credit card machine working yet so payment has to be by cash or through Venmo.
We ordered over the phone and were told it'd be 15-20 mins but actually it was about 45 mins before we got our food. Also, they didn't let us know about the cash-only thing while we were ordering; we found that out when we went for pickup. Thankfully we had enough cash on hand but I think not letting the customer know this in advance, especially during COVID times, is not cool.
We just got a manchow soup and paneer lollipops. The soup was good but didn't come with the crunchy noodles that manchow soup is normally served with. The paneer "lollipops" were just big balls of plain paneer in a little bit of some red sauce; we'd requested spicy but the sauce was really bland. The paneer was absolutely plain, not seasoned with anything; I ordered it because it seemed like a popular item at their Jersey City location (based on those Yelp reviews) but I would not recommend getting it. Also tried a couple of their pastries and they were okay.
We may give this place another chance to try their thalis once they work out their opening day kinks and indoor dining becomes safe again.
