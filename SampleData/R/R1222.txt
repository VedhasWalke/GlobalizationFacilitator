Delivery was good - within the estimated time and contactless.  The delivery person gave a call to let us know the food was being dropped to the door which we really appreciate.  
We ordered a couple different things to see what we thought.  Items ordered were samosa chaat, dabeli (sandwich), veg Manchurian (dry) and Hakka noodles.  
Samosa chaat and dabeli were good - nice seasoning, and spicy.  Samosa chaat had a bit too much oil in the chana that I normally don't see when I order this dish elsewhere.  Dabeli was tasty and had the fresh pomogranate seeds that gives the sandwich filling an extra pop. The bread on the sandwich was soft but didn't
fall apart when biting into it.  
One of my favorite types of food is Indo-Chinese food.  I have to say this place has not got the info Chinese food part down yet, but I hope they keep trying and improve.  Both the Hakka noodles and veg manchurian had an extreme overage of salt - so much so that it killed the rest of the flavor in the dish.  The salt was way too much even for outside food standards.  I hope that the owners read this and take this feedback in a positive light because if they make those adjustments, the dish would be a knockout.  Also, I would recommend using less garlic in the veg manchurian (I love garlic, but this was borderline bitter with the amount used).
The only way I could eat the noodles was to cook plain noodles in double the quantity and stir fry with the Hakka noodles (I also added shredded cabbage and bok choy) - I did not add any additional seasoning or oil and the dish was able to be consumed at the right salt level.
I really want to see this place succeed in this community because we are starting to see new places open up!
