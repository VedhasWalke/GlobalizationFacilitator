I was partial to another Indian place just down the road from Jhopri, so since I was driving by, I ducked in to check out the other place's lunch buffet. It was almost 12:00...and the place was deserted. I walked around the rather disappointing offerings to see what they had and it was then that I noticed that I was the only person in restaurant. I could hear people in the kitchen but no one came out to greet or even offer to seat me so as I was leaving, I heard someone say 'thank you.'
So I drove back down to Jopri, walked in, and it was packed...
Ample buffet selection, and this time around, I was in luck as they had a lamb offering, alongside the usual tikka masala, dal, and a very, very good sag paneer (I had 3 helpings of it!).
This was my second time going so with regards to buffet selection, don't even bother going to my previous favorite (next to Bagel Street...sorry guys). You might wait a little bit in line if they are busy but they re-stock when you (nicely) ask them to and more often than not, the food is piping hot (because they replace it so often).
I can't speak for their regular menu but if you don't get to eat good Indian food that often, like me (we just don't have anything great by where I live), and you want to have a nice, easy sit down lunch, try Jhopri...oh, and whatever that chile salmon dish was that they had, pretty amazing!
