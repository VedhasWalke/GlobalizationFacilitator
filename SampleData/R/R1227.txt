My sister has been getting take out from this location since 2018 , was always cheered us up...
But the food we got on November 6th 2020 was not acceptable, I understand there is a pandemic but how can you serve Paneer Tikka Appetizer which felt like it was 3 days old ,it wasn't soft paneer, the taste was not even close to the ones we have got it past...
And it wasn't even enough for 2 people...
For $26, I felt that food quality has gone down so much !!
