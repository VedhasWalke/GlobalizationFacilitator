So I came here to pick up some food before work.
I heard about this place from work because other co- workers ate from here. I also heard this place is tied to Cross Culture in Princeton.
One thing that this place does NOT have is lunch specials . They have a lunch buffet but no lunch special or else we would order more from here for lunch.
Anyway I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala  and Garlic naan. It is expensive here -$16 for dinner. Yikes. Only comes with rice. Garlic naan was like 3 more bucks.
Anyway they had my order ready in less than 15mins.
Place is very cute/nice inside .
The Garlic naan was ok. But the Chicken Tikka Masala was DELICIOUS. Big serving for being $16 bucks . Could feed 2 I think.
I think if this place delivered and had lunch specials that they would see way more orders from my job!
