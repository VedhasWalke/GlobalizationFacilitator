Came here for dinner a few days back and thought it was OK but not great.
There are numerous parking lots right near the restaurant and I managed to find a spot right across the street. The ambiance inside the restaurant feels kind of high end but in a relaxed sort of way, so I'm into that. Throughout my meal, the server was pretty much absent - I did feel like I was neglected slightly because I was eating by myself. For example, my water was never refilled once during the entire meal, and it took a while to get my check after I was done. They did box up my leftovers for me, so that's always a plus for me :) Food-wise, it was fine. I got the chicken biryani and it was really salty and pretty one dimensional flavor-wise. It was the type of scenario where you take one bite and it tastes really good, but then you keep eating and you get a little more sick of it after each bite because it's all samey-samey. The portion size for the price was plentiful, though - my leftovers were pretty much the size of a normal meal.
Would I come back? Probably not since there are a number of other Indian restaurants in the area (even considering just Plainsboro!) and I'm always eager to try new places.
