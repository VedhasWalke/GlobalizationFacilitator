Great indian food in a nice setting.  Ate here for both a dinner and a lunch buffet - both were excellent.
Food is very high quality.  Dinner portions are nice size.  A typical chicken entree is $14 or $15 and nice size portion.
Favorite entree from dinner was the paneer tikka.  Favorite dish in the lunch buffet as the chicken chops (similar to chicken tandoori, but juicier and no orange color).
Restaurant feels very clean with new bathrooms and furniture.
BYO.
