Didn't like the service and quality of food that we were served . When we requested for an item that was served on other table, the answer was "oh that's not standard we made it for them. If you want I will bring papad and onions , tomatoes separately and you can make it on your own" . Then I was waiting for someone to check on our table and  literally we have to call somebody to ask for pickle as the food that we ordered was not that great in taste, he brought large cup of pickle and charged 2.5$ . While leaving I looked for mouthh  freshener that they keep usually, he didn't even bother and when asked he said "we don't have today" .  I will avoid this place next time
