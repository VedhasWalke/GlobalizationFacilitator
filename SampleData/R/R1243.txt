THERE ARE ROACHES IN HERE!!!! I love the food but can't stand behind a restaurant that knowingly has roaches and still services consumers. The staff here was extremely aloof & did not seem to care about the fact a roach scurried across my foot. Roaches multiply quickly. They offered us a mere 15% discount for our troubles. I don't think that accurately accommodates the experience of roaches. They should fix this immediately.
