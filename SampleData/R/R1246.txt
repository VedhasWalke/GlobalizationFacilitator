Came here for lunch and overall the food was decent.
Service was prompt and friendly. The space itself is very pretty.
This place is a great foray into Indian food if you don't want things too spicy. The lunch is buffet style, with a variety of meat and veggie options/sides to choose from. It's not a huge buffet- about 15 things to choose from, and then 2 dessert options (rice pudding and a mango dessert).
Overall, worth a visit for lunch if you're in the area.
