I came here multiple times , sometimes it's great, other times it's average. The food is not that authentic, definitely Americanized. The worst was the chai tea , they changed the recipe so much I couldn't recognize it. The dishes are a hit and miss and service needs a lot of improvement, even when it's an empty restaurant, they don't check on the table for a long time. I have higher expectations for Indian food in Princeton and this definitely below average.
