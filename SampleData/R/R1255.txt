Had lunch buffet here today after almost an year. Not sure if the chef is still the same because the quality of food has degraded. I found hair in their chicken Tikka masala serving pot. Had to tell the server who just took the entire pot inside and removed the hair and got it back.
Chicken malai kabab was very salty. They used to have variety for appetizers but today they just had potato vada and chicken malai kababa. Only the potato vada was good.
Their chat was stale. Chicken curry was tasteless. Other curries were not very great either. No achar this time
Kheer and custard were great.
Found centipede in their washroom. Gross!
Won't go back.
