Upscale place to have Indian food. Soothing ambience,friendly staff and tasty food adds up to a good choice. Little expensive but I am fine going there once in a while. We liked their mix pakora starter, soup was turned down for me. However daal makhani in main course was yummy.
Surrounding has quite a few shopping options so have other options to spend time.
