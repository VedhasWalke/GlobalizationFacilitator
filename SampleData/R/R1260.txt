Went there for Sunday buffet after reading reviews as we were in the area. Restaurant decor and ambience was good, service was friendly and prompt as well. It's a decent size restaurant so not cramped up.
3 star rating (actually would give 3.5 star) is because food was average. Was bland for authentic Indian taste, and lacked basic spices. Naan was piled up in buffet area, and not delivered to seat (as in most indian buffet these days) so didn't taste fresh like made to order.There is no dosa, vada, etc in buffet as shown in one of the pictures.
There is ample parking near restaurant.
