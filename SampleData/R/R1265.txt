I have dined in a few times in the past several months so this review is strictly for their lunch buffet. The buffet was OK and nothing special.
For apps they had fried pakora, chicken and papdi chaat. The chicken was dry and hard to chew from the constant heating. It also seemed like it was made way in advance and filled it as needed.
For main course they had a few options to pick from. My favorite malai kofta but all the dishes could have used a tad bit more of flavoring and spice.
At the very start the buffet area was clean but as more customers came in the cleanliness around the buffet station went down. Just a small suggestion, keep the area clean and also have name tags with what the food item is and what its made from in case people have allergies or do not know what the dish is.
