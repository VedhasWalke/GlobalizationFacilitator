Good for lunch buffet with a big group. Nice ambience and wide selection of appetizers and entrees if you eat both both veg and non veg items. The curries and biryani in the lunch buffet were on the milder side in terms of spiciness. There were two kinds of dessert and fruit to finish off the buffet. The price per person is similar to other Indian buffets in the area however I felt the quality and ambience was a level up compared to other Indian restaurants in the vicinity
