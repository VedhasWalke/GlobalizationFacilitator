Not planning to return! I went there for the weekend buffet, which was ok, nothing spectacular. Lots of kids, running wild. One dropped a pair of tongs down from the platter of naan. He just picked them up and put them right back on the platter. I told a server, who just shrugged at first, then, seeing that I wouldn't let it go, took away the tongs... platter of naan stayed right where it was...
