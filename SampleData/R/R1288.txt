Came here for the first time on Mother's Day with my family. The interior and ambiance is very nice and classy! They have this circular booths that are cushioned as well as tables and chairs (the chairs are velvety and nice.. not like those regular wooden chairs you normally see in the restaurants). Since there was a lunch buffet, we chose to do that! It was a bit pricey in my opinion but then for mothers.. cost is nothing. There was a wait for 25 mins which wasn't super bad. We got seated after 25 mins and i'm glad i didn't have to wait longer even though it was packed! We got seated and then we got up for the lunch buffet. There were a separate buffet for appetizers and a separate one for the main course! For appetizers, I got the samosa, veg hakka noodles and veg manchurian! My favorite was the samosa and the veg manchurian! The veg hakka noodles were okay okay.. lacked flavor in my opinion. But if you mixed the manchurian gravy with the hakka noodles then it tasted pretty good otherwise i would not recommend simply getting the veg hakka noodles. Since i'm a vegetarian, for the main course, i tried little of everything: white rice, malai kofta, palak paneer, shahi paneer, dal makhani, and naan! Wasn't a huge fan of malai kofta.. it had a really strong coconut-ey flavor which made me nauseous! I really liked the palak paneer and the shahi paneer gravy! For dessert, they had this amazing mango de fresco which was basically mango custard with green grapes! Hands down sooooo delicious!!! They also had assorted fruits and gulab jamun. Again, i dislike gulab jamun so i didn't try that all. Overall, my family enjoyed the food and it was a great Mother's Day lunch! :) I will come back again to try other dishes!
