First time here... nice atmosphere. The food meh... nothing to write home about. Limited menu and pretty pricey. Way better to drive 15 min north to eat a guru palace. The waiters have zero personality and you can hardly hear them or understand them.. and also the ladies restroom was pretty dirty. Any restauranteur will tell you that if a restroom is dirty, good chances the kitchen is dirty. Yeah I won't be back
