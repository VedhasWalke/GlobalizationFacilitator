First time I ate here today, a colleague recommended the place. Great place for buffet lunch, and the food... is just delicious. I tried the briyani chicken rice, the naan bread, this tiny spinach ball, and this yellow-curried potato ball. I dont know what it's called, but it's my favorite. Will definitely come back.
