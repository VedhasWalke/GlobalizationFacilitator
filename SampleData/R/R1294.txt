Jhopri is the perfect addition to the Village of Plainsboro.  Owners of this restaurant as well as Cross Culture in Princeton, they know how to consistently provide a delicious Indian meal.  I have ordered take out once and just had their lunch buffet.  $12 is a great deal for a variety of dishes which changes on a daily basis.  Many of the Indian buffets I know are stuck in a rut offering the same dishes every day.  This place consistently adds and removes items to keep the buffet intriguing.  Decor is amazing on the inside.  You would never know from the unassuming outside.  Service was subtle and always right there.
