I recommend trying Jhopori at lunchtime first. That's so you can sample the many amazing, delicious Indian dishes they prepare, and decide which one you might like to have for dinner sometime. At $12pp, it's a great value, given the variety, excellent service, and quality of the food.
I would recommend the Lamb Saagwala and the Spicy Chicken -- both delicious and both gluten free (as are most dishes at Jhopori). While this spacious restaurant sits at the end of the Plainsboro Center mall, the interior decor is anything but "mall-like". In fact, it's quite nice, possibly even romantic in the evening. There are many decent Indian places to choose from in Central NJ, but this is surely one of the best.
