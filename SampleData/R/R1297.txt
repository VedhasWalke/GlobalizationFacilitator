Consistently delicious, quality food, well prepared. The lunch buffet today felt like a greatest hits selection, with Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Rogan Josh, among other selections. Dessert offerings were also carefully curated, with Mango d'Fengo, Gulab Jamun and Rice Pudding. To the Jhopri team - keep it up!
