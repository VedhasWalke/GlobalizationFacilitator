We come here as family for weekday dinner. First time we really loved the menu but felt prices were high. We still came back!!
However this time the server was rude and did not show enough attention to specifics of the order placed. When we mentioned about it he was trying to argue.
Malai kofta - my son's favorite and Biryani was both awful this time. Did not expect the taste to be so bad for the money we pay.
