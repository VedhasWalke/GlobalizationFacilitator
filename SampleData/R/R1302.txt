Having read some of these reviews regarding the waiter service made me laugh. It's a buffet, other then refilling your drink, what else is there to say??
I came here for the lunch buffet with a couple coworkers.  
Didn't even bother sitting when I walked in as I headed straight for the buffet.  Definitely came at a good time as it seemed most of the dishes had just been prepared.  Food was amazing to say the least. Some of the selections of Indian food to choose from - tikka masala, lamb with curry, kheer, panner makhni.  The lamb with curry was definitely my favorite, had plenty of taste and slight spice kick to it.  I like my Indian food extremely spicy, however, most of the dishes here had little to no spiciness. I didn't mind it though as all the dishes had a good distinct taste, especially the meats.  When you have a buffet like this, you want to be able to distinguish the different flavors of meat and I felt they accomplished that. This was by far the best Indian food I've had in Jersey.  
This is just the first of many trips that I'll be making to Jhopri.
