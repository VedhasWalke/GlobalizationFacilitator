This is the best Indian restaurant in Bucks-Mercer county area. The food is fresh and very tasteful. We never go wrong eating here. All vegetarian entrees are good. I really have no words to describe the food here, you have to try it out for yourself.
The only thing I would recommend is to hire a professional hotel manager. The service could be improved.
