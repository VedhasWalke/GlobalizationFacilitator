When me and my wife was looking for good Indian food close by after we moved from north we found this place. It is located in small strip mall in plainsboro town. We loved this place from our first visit and now a frequent customer. Very good ambiance and food options are good too.
The customer base is very diverse every time we go and the spice level is just right for people who don't prefer spicy food.
