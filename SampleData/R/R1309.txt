We went for a weekday buffet and experienced terrible service. One person amongst the wait staff splashed the water jug on the table, floor and the seats (he was short and stocky). He then proceeded to do a sloppy job of cleaning the water from the floor and the floor remained wet as we had our lunch. It was a buffet service so we had to walk around with wet shoes all over the restaurant.
As we went through the buffet service, our plates were never cleaned, nor the empty water jugs replenished despite us explicitly asking the wait staff to do so. Finally, the restaurant added a 18% gratuity for the poor service despite giving no service at all... I was really hoping to contest the gratuity charge but I have no interest in picking up a fight in front of my colleagues and just wanted to leave. No self-respecting restaurant will want to earn gratuity like this. Please earn your gratuity. Parties of 6 or more should not mean a free pass to do as you please. Next time we will avoid this place for a group lunch.
