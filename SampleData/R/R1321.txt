I used to live a stone's throw away from this place. I waited anxiously everyday on my way in and out of the library for this place to open. I happened to go to this place for a lunch date. What a delight. Fantastic prices for the quality of food. Good naan service at the table. Buffet had quite some variety. The desserts were wonderful.
My concerns are with the dosas, which could have been made better and the staff, more friendlier. They were more concerned about running the kitchen than making sure the guest are doing alright and taken care of. I would go back here if "crown of India" was closed. Good for the price though.
