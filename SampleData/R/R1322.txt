We frequent this restaurant quite a bit. It's one of the few restaurants that gets better and better every time we go. The service, the food, the ambiance is all top notch. I see no reason to go to any other Indian restaurant in the area, Jhopri will be our go to Indian restaurant in the region. Fantastic job, keep it up and I encourage everyone to go to Jhopri to satisfy their Indian food cravings! I'm looking forward to my next meal at Jhopri!
