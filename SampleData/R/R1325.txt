Visited Jhopri for the lunch buffet and was able to sample a lot of tasty Indian dishes. The food was freshly prepared and there was a nice variety of items on the menu. Reasonably priced and a nice experience. Taking a star off for the service, asked 3 times for another pitcher of water since we had a large party and never got it. Automatic gratuitiy when I got my own food and couldn't get the staff to bring out a pitcher of water? Not a fan.
