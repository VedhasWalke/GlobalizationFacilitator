I travel to this area frequently and a stop at Jhopri for dinner is always a must.  Don't simply order off the menu - talk with the waitstaff about options and the  right level of spice to request with the dish (many offer a range of 1-10; I personally like 6).  Big fan of the Panir Masala (with orders of garlic naan and raita on the side).  The staff make great recommendations for Indian food novices like me.
Also, their BYOB policy is nice.  Swing by Plainsboro Wine and Liquor (a short distance away) and bring a beverage to enjoy with your dinner.
Great place - I will continue to stop in for dinner whenever I am in the area!
