I came here for the buffet on Thursday and it was good but definitely not worth 5 stars. The price is reasonable but the food items did not even include biryani which is always a must in Indian buffets. The food wasn't extraordinary but I guess for the price it was decent. The place itself is clean and the atmosphere is lovely which is why it earns 4 stars. Also the chaat was great! Probably my favorite part of the buffet.
