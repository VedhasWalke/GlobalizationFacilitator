As a long time fan of Indian food, we were thrilled when we first heard a new place was coming to central Jersey. And Jhopri doesn't disappoint.
Honestly - could run through the entire menu and just check off 'that was excellent too' for each one. So I won't do that. (But I could...)
You'll love the naan, you'll love the chicken tikka masala, you'll love the mint cilantro dip (Tip: keep it for the naan...)
Perhaps one of the smartest things Jhopri owners did for folks who may be new to Indian - you can order your dish's heat based on a 1-10 scale. So...if you go overboard and get something too spicy - remember...the salted lassi is great too. :)
5 star. As good as it gets.
