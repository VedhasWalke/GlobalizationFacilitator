Indian food is definitely an acquired or inherited taste. I personally do not like cilantro, heavy spices, cumin, or curry, which are all innately abundant in this genre of cuisine. I do like tandoori chicken, samosas, and okra. Those are pretty similar wherever you get them. I feel like all Indian places I've tried are generally similar. In my opinion I would rather have most other food than Indian or Asian food, so this is coming from someone who really doesn't like this type of food to begin with. I can't really knock the restaurant if it is food that I just generally am not into, but if you are into that then I'm sure you'll enjoy it. These restaurants always have a very calm, cool atmosphere and aesthetic quality with nice colors and dim lighting that set a very zen type of mood. It is for sure a place to come and be at peace, just maybe in your brain instead of your mouth or stomach. I also am not a fan of Indian desserts like the green gooo or orange goop. But go there because you might like it
