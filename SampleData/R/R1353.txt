Let me first say, that i've lived in plainsboro for over 10 years and been to countless restaurants. I'm a huge foodie and indian food is one of my favorites.
I've never written a yelp review in my entire life until now.
This had to be the most bland indian food i've ever tasted.
I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the lamb, chicken, or any other meats they offered for the lunch buffet. Everything was absolutely was dry and flavorless. As other reviewers have mentioned, the naan was oil and bland.
The only thing that salvaged the meal was some of the sauces on the naan.
Honestly, the best part of the meal was the fruit (my sister and I both agree).
SERVICE:
Not once was I asked how my food was (it was pretty empty for the majority of our time there)
I will definitely never come here again, and continue to go to my go to spot in Hamilton for indian food. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the place!
