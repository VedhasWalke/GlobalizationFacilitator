I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with the ambience and service. I had the weekend buffet and was delighted by the spread and selections and though I mostly tasted the vegetarian choices, I loved the taste. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes quality Indian food.
