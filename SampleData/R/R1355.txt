Jhopri is the best Indian food I've ever had. We frequently used to go here for take out, and this place is delicious, though that was a year ago. I really loved the portions, the flavor, and the overall quality of food! I've only eaten here once and the restaurant is located in a cute area, decorated tastefully, and had attentive staff.
