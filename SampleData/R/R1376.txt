I went to this restaurant for the first time to try lunch buffet.
Food was just ok and service was poor and it was expensive for value.
Food overall didn't have much flavor. Appetizers and salad were good but not the main dishes like curries. There was no flavor and it was just salty.
There are so many Indian restaurants in central Jersey. I will not return to this restaurant.
