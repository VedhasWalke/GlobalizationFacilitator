We ordered hara bhara kabab, malai kofta, bhindi, daal tadka and Rotis.. everything was bland, literally everything. We couldn't eat anything. To top it all, bhindi was under cooked.. This is the worst indian food we've ever had. Service is super slow too, especially surprising because we were here on Wednesday evening.
