My husband and I have eaten at most of the Indian restaurants in Princeton/plainsboro, and can truly say this is our new favorite place.  The food is excellent, portions fair, service attentive, and decor is truly beautiful.  This place really adds to the value of living in Plainsboro, a place that generally lacks in diverse and quality restaurants. Go try it! You won't be sorry.
