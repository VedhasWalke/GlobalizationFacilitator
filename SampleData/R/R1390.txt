First time last weekend and we were impressed.  We had our usual chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, veg pakora, roti, raita, and gulab jamun for dessert.  The dishes were well prepared and fresh.  Service was good too. This will be our new "go to" place and it puts a lot of the other local Indian restaurants to shame.
