This is a new place that is doing everything right. The staff and I mean all of them were on point. Part of this might be I had an early dinner before they got busy. Yet the service was great and the food was excellent. I have seen great Indian restaurants like the DC Bombay, so it's hard to rate this 5 stars. My guess is that the if they keep this up for another 6 months, I expect nothing less.
