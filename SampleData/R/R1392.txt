As an Indian I am a picky eater when it comes to going to an Indian Restaurants. I went for lunch to give it try. Great food for the price, and the curry's are not as heavy like other Indian restaurants I have been too. I took my parents for dinner and going forward Jhopri is our Indian spot in the Princeton Metro area.
