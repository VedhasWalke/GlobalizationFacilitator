We went for the lunch buffet at Jhopri after it being much recommend by friends. To our dismay, we were terribly disappointed. The minced mutton was chewy and seemed perhaps stale. There was a strand of hair in the chicken gravy, which made it even less appetising. A mere verbal apology with an option of the dish being remade fresh was offered, which I declined because I didn't want to wait for the fresh batch on a working day lunch break nor risk a dish being prepared and served in a rush. As it is, the idea of eating "hairy chicken" and feeding it to my six month foetus was off putting and unhealthy. No compensatory gesture was levied out what so ever as even an act of courtesy. The dal makhni was anything but makhni. It was dry and listless.The food was flavour less and it seemed , it was prepared by a bored amateur chef for the sake of simply putting it out to consume. The Chicken tikkas were served with a label of chapli kababs. A restaurant  claiming to specialise in Indian food ought to know the difference. The gajar ka halwa ( carrot halwa) and kheer (rice pudding) was a tad bit of a solace ( relatively), but then obviously we have had better. All in all a very disappointing experience.
We were asked for feedback and it was well received with an assurance of a better experience next time. However I highly doubt we will be going there again.
