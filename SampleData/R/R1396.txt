Would NOT recommend this restaurant if you like good Indian food,good service at a fair price. That's a tough combo to find what' up with that. The food selection was weak and just plain tasting(bad ball). I have had better. No host to greet you at entrance. After being seated no bread or dosa was served as mentioned by the waiter(bad ball). As for the bill not a good value at $14 for buffet(bad ball). Save your money.
