This review is just for the biryani. I visit my sis in law in Plainsboro often and one lazy evening we just didn't want to cook. So we ordered from the Hut on my niece's recommendation.
I was blown away by the biryani! We ordered both the goat and chicken dum biryani and they were absolutely amazing! I live in Jersey City and every biryani place by us Hyderabadi, which I am so over. All those biryanis are over the top laden with spices to the point that my taste buds can't feel anything but the heavy spices. But this was a breath of fresh air. The rice was long grained and perfectly cooked (not sticky), the masala wasn't too spicy and hit all the right notes of spice coupled with hints of acid. The chicken was perfectly juicy. This is my new fav biryani ever. Now every time we visit we get a bunch of biryani to go for JC! I wish they would open one here, but I am crazy enough to drive an hour and half to the Hut!
