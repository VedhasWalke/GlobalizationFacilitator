First let me say that I didn't have a great experience here but the only reason I have it 4 stars was because of how the management, especially Mayur, handled my situation. This was my first time here and I ordered the Mattar Paneer (medium) and Dal Makhani (med-spicy). I ordered it directly from their online ordering system for take out. Once home the Mattar Paneer was extremely spicy...I mean EXTREMELY SPICY. I called and complained and Mayur told me that they would give me the same dish on the house when I came in next time. I told him gay my kids can't even eat that item and asked him to refund just hay item but he said that he couldn't. Obviously I was upset because now I need to find something to feed the kids. To my surprise, Mayur called me back and told me that they were going to rerun the entire bill...I proceeded to tell him that I only wanted a refund for that one item but he insisted and processed the refund for the entire bill. Great customer service and hence the 4 stars. The Dal Makhani was very good and I was very happy with the breads as well. I will definitely go back to dine in! Thank you Mayur!
