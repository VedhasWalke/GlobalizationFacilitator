Kesar's offers a mixed menu of North and South Indian Vegetarian Dishes.  Everything from Punjabi entrees of Aloo Gobi and Dal Makhni to Dosa specialties of the south and street food of Mumbai encompasses the all vegetarian menu.  A nice mix of food and regions offered at very reasonable prices.
I went with Saag and Maki Roti (spinach and corn roti).  One of my all time favorite foods of Punjab.  And I have to say, they nailed it.  It was so good.  A little on the spicy side, but the flavors and roti were excellent.  We also ordered the Baigan Bharta with Bajre Ki Roti.  This entree was just ok.  I had never heard of Bajre ki Roti, apparently it is found predominantly in the southern state of Rajastan and it's supposedly a gluten free bread made of millet.  
We also ordered some masala chai.  It was large mug, but lacking a bit on the masala part. Our server was very friendly.  It did take a while to get our food, but the taste made it worth the wait.
