I live in an area that luckily has a ton of Indian restaurants. This has been by far my favorite that I have come across in Plainsboro. The delivery time is fast, and the food is incredible. I also believe that the value for the amount and quality of food is quite fair. I have never eaten in the restaurant itself so, I cannot speak to the in-house dining experience, but, I am definitely ordering from here again.
