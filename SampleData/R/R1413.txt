We can here on a Saturday night to celebrate Mother's Day weekend. I love that it is all vegetarian so there is not need to worry about cross contamination. Also, the decor is really nice and pictures of village life in India. They have a variety of options from North Indian, South Indian, Indo Chinese and Gujarati include Jain items. I got the Rajasthani Thali with a paneer masala, bajra rotla, baingan bharta (eggplant), lentils, gatte nu shaak, rice, dessert and papad. I would recommend sukhdi (jaggery sweet) with this dish vs jalebi. The Kesar special thali was really good and came with different curries and fresh tawa rotis. The pakora khadi was really good. We also ordered veg Manchurian which was spicy and flavorful. We will definitely come back again.
