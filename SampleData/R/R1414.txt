Delicious Indian food. I didn't know quite what to expect, since I have just recently started exploring the cuisine, but the staff was extremely helpful and friendly in making recommendations.
I ended up ordering the Punjabi Thali, and it was a delicious combination of flavors!
I paired it with a delicious mango/yogurt drink. It hit the spot.
This is a vegetarian place, but I never felt like the dishes needed anything else to enhance the flavor.
I especially enjoyed the chickpeas!
I highly recommend checking them out!
