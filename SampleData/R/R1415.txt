The food is absolutely amazing. I was actually shocked by how good the food was. The raj kachori chaat was amazing. It was a modern twist on an India classic. I also had the punjabi tali. My husband couldn't pick his favorite item from the tali. Really big servings and great service.
I will be returning in the near future.
