Nice decor and ambiance, casual but a little spruced up at the same time so it was very nice for a group dinner.
The food was tasty, portions were good. The roasted eggplant special was delicious! Nice dessert counter to choose lots of little sweets from as well
Very nice service and the owner was present and checking in with customers. Friendly atmosphere, would certainly go again
