Unfortunately not the best experience. Big venue right in the Plainsboro town center. This location has had a lot of turnover in businesses. Due to my own mistake we had thought it was a buffet based on previous visits, not take out.
When coming into the restaurant their is a lot of open seating. You must order at the register. If you pay with cash you get a 7% discount. We ordered a couple different Curry dishes. The curry was good but the meat was lacking in freshness. If you decide to dine in, they only provide plastic utensils, and it is all self serve. However when our food came out to our table, to my surprise it was served on paper plates! That is definitely a first. While my family was expecting a little more of a refined dining experience, it was no where close. There are plenty of other Indian restaurants in town, and I would respectfully recommend trying those restaurants first based on my experience.
