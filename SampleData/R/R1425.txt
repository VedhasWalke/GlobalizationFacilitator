We ordered the mirchi bajji, chaat, and shaam savera with lachha paratha.  Overall everything was delicious and very flavorful.  My only complaint was that the lachha paratha wasn't actually paratha...seems like they tried to make it out of what they use for naan and it didn't taste that great.  The masala chai was delicious as well.
