This is a Good Indian Restaurant.
It's a nice sit down family style restaurant.
The menu has a lot of variety options.
It includes traditional Thali Dishes the Saag's were okay, it was spicy even though I asked for mild.
The Punjabi saags were good and mild "like I asked'.
Overall food is good and everyone will enjoy.
Staff was nice and friendly to everyone.
I will recommend to everyone.
