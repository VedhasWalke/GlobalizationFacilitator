When I picked up my order I saw the lady behind the counter accidentally drop a spoon on the floor. She picked it up and put it back along with the clean spoons. She noticed that I was watching but all the same. I felt very uncomfortable and disposed of the food when I got back home. I hesitated about posting a comment but thought it would not be responsible of me to stay silent and not to warn others about the lack of cleanliness of this place. I will never order again from here.
