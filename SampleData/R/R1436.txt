We went there for my uncle's bday celebration and it was a bummer. The chat had so much chat masala in it that it tasted salty. The mango lassi served was with split milk. When asked the server, she said it just has less amount of mango pulp! The onion kulcha was under cooked tasting more like a dough. Overall food didn't taste that great either. The service is very slow. The check had wrong items on it.
