Great food, even greater service. So far I have had 4-5 lunches at this restaurant (in the last two months) and my experience has been excellent. Food is quite nice. But, the best experience has been their service. The lady who runs the place (Meena) would make you feel as a guest at here place, rather than a customer of her restaurant. I've never felt so well treated and honored at any other restaurant. The owners used to run a restaurant in Long Island for several years prior to starting Kesar and have extensive hospitality experience. Highly recommended.
