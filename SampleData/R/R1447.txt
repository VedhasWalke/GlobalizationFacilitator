Well, walked in group of 6 and desired to know what items are given in various Thalis. Asked the gentleman about different items as menu given didn't give details. The gentleman sarcastically said" I am tired of telling what each thali has, so order if you want to or ......... " OMG, what happened to the hospitality in food business. It was goodness of our group to NOT walk out. Ordered 6 thalis, & KulFi. The food was ok. The host given a benefit of doubt for kidding to NEW customer but Next visit we need to think about!!
