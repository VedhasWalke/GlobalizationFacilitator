I absolutely love the food here, it's amazing.   I'm addicted to the Kesar Thali, which provides such a nice variety of flavors (sample dish with five small entree tastes).  I've been here at least five times and the quality is amazing, it's fresh, and you can taste it. I've tried a few of the entrees and most memorable is the aloo gobi which wasn't heavily sauced, but it was perfectly spiced.  I loved it.   This is a vegetarian/vegan restaurant.
