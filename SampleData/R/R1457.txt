Horrible service ! Had to wait 10 mins for someone to seat in a less than half full restaurant, another 10 mins to get someone to provide water and take order. Most frustrating part was the owner or manager was revolving around a group of about 15 people that were probably related to the owner. The trend of ignoring customers continued for another few customers that walked in the restaurant. Need to get customer focus else will fail soon.
