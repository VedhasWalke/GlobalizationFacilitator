The food here was outstanding. I had the amritsari kulcha thali. Everything was well spiced and flavorful. For someone who wants to try several things, I will take a fresh thali over a generic buffet any day. The restaurant does need a better menu; there is no way to know what comes with the different thalis without asking. Small criticism though; the restaurant is highly recommended. Decor is casual - not a date night place - but perfectly pleasant.
