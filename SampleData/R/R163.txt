Please note, I am writing this review regarding their delivery service and not their food. I placed an order online, which seemed fairly straightforward. However, I had to call them twice an hour later only to realize they never got my order as their fax machine wasn't working. Further, on the website there was no way to cancel the order!? When I started reading out my order to the person on other side of the phone, he said the items are not available. Now I am stuck waiting for them to deliver food to me, 2 hours later.
