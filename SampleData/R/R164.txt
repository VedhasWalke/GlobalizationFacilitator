Simple message ..... stay away.
I just have a question why open up a restaurant if you have not worked out the process if ordering and fulfilling an irder
We ordered chaat, dosa, palak panner, lassi and roti
Dosa came up with loads of whole black pepper seeds ...... never ever seen that before. Tasted spicy and rava dosa was soft when it should be crispy. Sent it back and asked for one without black pepper. Took almost 20 minutes for it to be ready
My daughter ordered salted lassi and we did not get it at all. Reminded once and they said they are bringing it out. Asked again and they said it's ready but then came and told us they ran out and can give us mango lassi.....really!!!!!!! Simple order and they messes up
Alu papri Chaat was tasteless ..... runny chutney and nothing to savor about
Roti and palaak paneer was ok
My wife suggests giving them a 2nd chance  but i dont believe in 2nd chances when they mess up on simple items and food is tasteless
My recommendation is there are better places than this and dont waste your money here
