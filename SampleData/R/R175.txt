I ordered lunch takeout from the specials. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with goat curry, chicken leg, naan, rice and salad. Not sure what they gave me because I got a kabob instead of a chicken leg and no salad, but it was still delicious. The meat was very tender and whatever curry I got tasted good. Again not spicy but I don't like spicy. Overall, I don't think they understood my order or else they didn't have the ingredients for it, but it was still good and for $8 it was a lot of food. The yogurt sauce is really good as well.
