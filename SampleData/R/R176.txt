Efficient service for ordering halal meat products with a number assigned and ETA given. The good quality meat is cut very cleanly and promptly. Personnel are friendly and helpful. The store is small, the door doesn't close behind you, and the rough road entrance/exit is somewhat challenging. Ready made food is appetizing. They also offer catered trays that are worthwhile. They have an innovative rewards system whereby you check in every visit and earn points for discount.
