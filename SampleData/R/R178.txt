Overall very happy with the concept of this place and it's great to see a local business jam packed with customers.  The prices are a steal as we ordered up a mix of kebabs and indian cuisine.  The ghobi manchurian was delicious... Not overly spicy and just the right amount of sweetness.  We tried both veggie and beef filled samosas which weren't greasy and hit the spot.  I like the little takeout heated display with masala chicken, samosas, and various types of kebabs ready to go so you can hit the road fast.  It's hard to rave about a side order of rice but for $2.99 you have enough for 4 people and it's the best I've ever tasted. Lamb kebab was extremely tough however and was not exactly pleasing to the eye.  I'd post a picture like I usually do but that would be a instant turn off for all.  I'll definitely be back soon but I'll skip on the lamb kebabs for eternity.
