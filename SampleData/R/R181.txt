Guys be careful while ordering food here. Today i ordered kheer( Indian pudding) and it was stale and bitter. Before ordering I even checked if it was fresh, even then they tried to fool around. Luckily I tasted there and found that it was not at all human eatable. Highly highly highly disgusting and disappointed !! Will Never go the place.
