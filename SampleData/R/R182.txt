Tried a bit of the lunch special #6, the chicken tikka masala with lamb curry and kebab, it was not bad, but I didn't attempt to eat it further out of concern for my well being. The alarming aspect of my experience with this place was the total disregard by the staff for safe handling of raw meat. The owner/cashier handled raw meat with the gloves he was wearing, and without removing the gloves he handed the bag over to me, took the card for processing the payment, totally grossed me out. Additionally, another member of the staff who prepped my lunch order was behind the counter handling raw meat, as soon as I placed my order he went in the kitchen without removing the gloves which he was clearly using before to handle chopped goat for a prior customer when I walked in. I simply couldnt risk eating my lunch assuming that he changed his gloves inside the kitchen. The staff is respectful and courteous, but sadly I will not be going here again, the staff definitely needs a training on USDA raw meat handling procedures.
