Chicken kabobs are good from here, but not a big fan of the other food. We often get fresh boneless chicken breast from here as well. Avoid the beef, seems to be pink in color and very fatty... even when you request the lean. Not my go to meat shop, but it's location is convenient for urgent situations.
