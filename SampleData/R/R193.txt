YUM!
After hours of driving, we decided to make a pit stop and get some food at the first Indian-food place we could find, which happened to be Asian Halal Meat and Kebab House. It's a small family owned place, and the owners are all very nice and friendly. They told us that although they're usually closed on Mondays they had stayed open for Memorial day.
The place seems to be very popular with the south-asian community here. While we were here people kept coming and the owner seemed to know them all pretty well.
Its a small store that offers halal meat, (because of the memorial day barbecues a lot of people were getting marinated meat)  as well as Indian takeout.
We got some aloo tikkis, naan (which was so heavenly soft), samosas, kabab and butter chicken among other things and everything was fresh, warm and delicious! Yum!
There are also rows of packaged food on the shelves in front of the counter, like South Asian biscuits and drinks.
So if you're in the area and looking for some good, inexpensive food, check this place out.
