The worst place ever... If you go and order from here then just feel that you are eating trash..we ordered 100$ food and didn't eat even the food worth 5$.The owner sucks with stupid expressions..if you ever go and eat then you will just vomit.one star is also not worth giving. If there is an option of half star then I would rate it as half star..
