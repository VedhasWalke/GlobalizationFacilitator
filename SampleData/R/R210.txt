This take out has consistently good tasting South-East Asian fare (esp the kebabs and biriyani). They also butcher fresh cuts of meat on premises and sell it. Now that being said, we're slightly skeptical about the overall sanitary situation. There's a weird stench (odor of meat processing mixed with Pinesol) that engulfs you as soon as you walk in through the doors. Whatever the reason might be, the permeating smell is a bit off putting.
