Pretty good food, cheap, no frills.  The cilantro sauce is excellent.  The kabobs were slightly on the greasy side.  Also, I was expecting chunks of chicken, but the kebab was more like sausage, still pretty good though.  The chicken tikka was flavorful, tender, and not greasy.  Delicious!  Each item also comes with a salad instead of rice. If I came back I'd definitely go for the chicken tikka.
