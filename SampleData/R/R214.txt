Amazing indian food. Every time I've eaten the food from here, its just good. Compared to all those other indian places where the price of a small bowl of curry is like 8 bucks, this place is a steal. Love it love it love it. Love the onion naan and their curry goat? (the boneless one). I will always go here, my only problem is the dehydration that comes with eating at this place hence the 1 star docked.
