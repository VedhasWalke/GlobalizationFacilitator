We came to dine outdoors here and loved that the tent was so romantic despite the state of the world. They had music going, twinkle lights and Nassau street in the summer is always a nice ambiance to just enjoy a meal.
As for the food, we were impressed with how fast the service was considering they had to run in and out of the kitchen upstairs and bring it out. We started with a delicious Samosas appetizer and I could've honestly had another plate of those and called it a night.
But we decided to order a Mint special Kebab Platter as well. It came with a ton of chicken and some fancy potatoes too. Although the seasoning on the chicken was great (there were about 3 different types)! I definetely could've used some sauce with it because it was a bit dry. Not inedible dry...I guess I was used to other very saucey Indian dishes and wanted something to pair with a charred meat.  
Overall I would return, the food was good and the service was fast.
