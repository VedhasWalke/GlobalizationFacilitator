In the same location as where Mehek was a year or so ago, Mint is a welcomed new addition to the growing Indian-food scene here in Princeton. Compared to its neighbor Spice Grill, Mint is a lot smaller and relatively empty when I arrived. In terms of pricing, it's about on-par with the other Indian restaurants in the area, but I do think Chennai Chimney (a little farther down on Nassau Street) still offers the best prices, especially for the lunchtime buffet.
In terms of the food itself, Mint does offer pretty good quality food and a variety of options in their lunchtime buffet, but Jhopri (in Plainsboro) does offer many more options in a much bigger space. However, if you're looking for a nice meal on Nassau Street, Mint is definitely work a visit. I especially enjoyed their Biryani and their paneer makani, which were quite flavorful. It's not particularly spicy as well, which was great for some members of my party who had a lower spice tolerance.
The service was very attentive and everyone was very courteous, which was definitely a plus. I really enjoyed that they brought out fresh buttery naan whenever we wanted, which was a really nice addition as it was perfectly warm and crisp.
Good food but atmosphere remains a little too quiet and even marginally awkward. Not bad for an Indian place joint in downtown Princeton, but if you want the r deal, drive 20 min over to Plainsboro.
EDIT re: business owner comment: A well-sourced Yelp review compares food to its peer restaurants in the area. If The Mint is unable or unwilling to compete for loyal customers and patrons on an equal footing, then that anti-competitive behavior says more about the quality of its food than anything else.
