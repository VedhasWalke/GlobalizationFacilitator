I ordered the chicken samosas, chicken malai kabab, schezwan garlic noodles, and the naan bread platter. This was my first time having Indian cuisine and I loved it very much! Great flavors, and really nice staff. The male owner was very nice and polite. Hefty portions as well, would recommend. The outdoor seating is a little close in my opinion during COVID, but if you're comfortable, go for it.
UPDATE:
Within one day of posting this review, this restaurant put up clear plexi-glass like borders in response to COVID! Great customer service. Thank you!
