Only way to describe our experience: An explosion of flavors in your mouth! We've been going here/ordering take out for a few years now and have not ever been disappointed. Some of their best items: Whole fish in banana leaf, Crab masala (high spice level), Chicken lollipop, Gobi lollipop/ manchurian, veg pakodas.. I can go on. But those are just some that come to mind.
Along with the finger licking food, great service, attentive owner and being BYOB... what more can one ask for... Grab your favorite beer or wine bottle and experience the explosion...one bite at a time!
And to top it all off, all covid related precautions are taken with spaced out seating, masks, and water bottles.
