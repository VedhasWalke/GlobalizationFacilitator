Chef Matthew responded to my request for a vegan-ish Indian feast that we could pick up curbside, and he prepared about 7 or 8 dishes for us that were sublime! I gave him a dollar amount and said go for it, and we ate like kings. We will be enjoying the leftovers for days as well. Thanks to Matthew for brightening up our quarantine with outstanding and flavorful cuisine!!
