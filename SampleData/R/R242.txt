I've been consistently ordering meen polichathu for takeout . This time, size of fish was extremely small.
As Jebu has commented below, he did reduce the price by some $4 (I'm noticing it now). So I'm increasing the review points from 2 to 4. Please let people know about this in advance so that they know beforehand what to expect . Thnx
