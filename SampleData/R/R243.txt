This place was an absolutely phenomenal spot for some authentic Indian food that doesnt break the bank!   Fancy decor inside with dim lighting really made the difference to our dining experience. They offered veg and non veg options.
We started with appetizers which included cauliflower manchurian which was perfectly sauteed with the right amount of sauce and spice. I wish that they had entree portion sizes it was that yummy.
We then ordered for our entree chicken tikka masala, dosa, garlic naan, and a side of tamarind sauce.  The dosa dips were to die for. Chicken tikka masala was the perfect amount of creaminess with the chicken so soft I could cut the pieces with my fork. You could tell the garlic naan was so fresh just by the taste of the dough..perfectly gooey, buttery, and garlicky.
Everything here was just phenomenal and I would love to come back again!
