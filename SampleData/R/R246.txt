This place has some great hidden gems that you don't get at most typical Indian restaurants. Most Indian restaurants are actually Punjabi cuisine from northern India. The cuisine at this restaurant specializes in South Indian food made by a Nepalese chef.
The chef is quite thoughtful and balanced with his curries. The coconut tames even the hottest dishes even when ordered extra spicy. The dry shrimp dish that we ordered was the only dish that was extra spicy as requested with the right amount of curry leaves and toasted coconut.
The lobster curry was velvety and tender with a beautiful presentation. The crab curry was enjoyed by the table and I found it unique but tasted a little too much like paan for my liking.
The Kerala curry chicken was one of my favorites and highly recommend along with the pomfret fish dry and the curry fish was also quite good and a Kerala staple.
The chicken 65 was ok and I'd recommend the lollipop instead.
Breads were all good and my preference was the hot tandoori roti.
Goat curry had a delicious gravy but found the meat itself a touch chewy.  
The kulfi was amazing and the Gulab Jaman was also a hit.
