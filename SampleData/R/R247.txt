The food is just plain awesome. It's authentic Malayali food; no dumbing down the flavors and a good variety of choices on the menu.
But the real reason for this review is for the service levels. They went above and beyond in what is required to do. We are from out of town and as we were driving through the NJ turnpike, being heavily pregnant, I got a strong urge for my native Kerala food. The restaurant was 15 minutes from closing time and I called in for a pick order. They offered to stay some additional time until we get there and once we got there they were kind enough to dine in- five of us! And even let us order some more.
The food was fresh, hot and delicious! Thank you guys! Truly made my day.
