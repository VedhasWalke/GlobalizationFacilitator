Was craving some Indian food so came here today for lunch and was very impressed! The restaurant was small but not cramped, and we found a table in the corner immediately. The service was on point throughout our meal, but what really made me excited was the quality of the food. My chicken biryani was delicious! This restaurant definitely served the best Indian food I've had in the area, and while we generally enjoy trying out new places, we'll almost certainly be back again :) Two huge thumbs up for Kochi!
