Delicious and authentic dishes! We started with the Gobi 65! Yummy fully spiced cauliflower florets! Very delicious, this is definitely a very good and unique app to get. This was my first time trying this dish and enjoyed it very much. We also ordered the veggie samosas (yummy and a must to get at every Indian restaurant!). The samosas we're really big and delicious.
For our main dishes, we ordered the fish biryani - BY FAR MY FAVORITE! huge chunks of tender fish just swimming in all the deliciousness of the rice!
We also ordered the chicken masala - very creamy, rich and the chicken was tenderly cooked!
This place was very very very surprisingly delicious. I was a bit skeptical because it was in the middle of nowhere in an shopping center - don't let their location fool you. Must visit and must try! The dishes were perfection, packs all the flavors and spices, generous portions and the service is friendly. Will definitely go back again when in town!
