This is my first time to Kochi, but the food was very good. We got chicken tikka masala and chicken saagwala. Both dishes were very tasty and the right level of spicy. We both preferred the tikka masala over the saag. Nothing bad about the saagwala though, just not quite what I was expecting based on previous experience.
The service was fine, but nothing special. Took a long time to get the check at the end of the meal, and they never asked if we wanted dessert.  
Overall, we had a good experience and may return if we're back in the area!
