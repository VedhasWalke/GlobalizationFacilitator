This place was average. We got the vegetable samosas, dosa and payasam. The presentation of the samosas was excellent but the samosas in themselves did not taste fresh and more like the frozen ones you get at the Indian grocery store. The dosa was good albeit a bit thicker than we are used to. It was served on an odd appetizer plate which was too narrow and made it difficult to eat. The payasam was very different from what we are used to as it was dark brown and had rice instead of the vermicelli noodles. The server mentioned the brown color was because of the jaggery they used and that it was a speciality of the region. The ambience is quiet and they have South Indian music playing in the background. We might visit again to delve further into their South Indian specialities that we noticed some of the other tables seemed to be enjoying.
