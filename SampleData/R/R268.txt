Kochi had a really good food for the price point. It was about 13-15$ a dish. I had ordered the chicken tiki masala. My girlfriend had ordered a chicken bungari dish. The food was excellent and the service was phenomenal. The food was a bit too spicy for my girlfriend so she asked the waiter to see if it was possible to get a new dish that was less spicy. Without hesitation the waiter took our dish and gave us a new one. That was really amazing and the staff was really nice about everything. I completely love this restaurant and will definitely be back again.
TLDR, nice restaurant and service just if you are weak to spicy, get the mild
