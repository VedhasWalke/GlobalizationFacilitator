I was excited to try Kochi with my wife for lunch after reading the good reviews. My rating is 3.5 stars,  not quite average but not very good either.  With yelp you need to round up or round down, and I'm rounding up.
When we arrived I was disappointed that they didn't have a buffet, or a lunch menu.  They have an all day menu.  At the time I was hungry and was ready to chow down,  but would have to wait a little longer for my food.
Ordered the Gobi 65,  Paneer Tikka Masala,  and Eggplant Kuzhambu along with some Naan and Mango Lassi. Overall the food was decent.  Of all the dishes, we enjoyed the Gobi 65 the most.  This dish is battered and fried cauliflower in a  spicy seasoned sauce. It really had  good heat level and had good flavor.  Only thing I would change with this dish is I wish the cauliflower was cooked a little less soft,  to give it extra texture. The batter was also  soft after mixing with the sauce. The paneer Tikka Masala was my second favorite dish.  It tasted ok the paneer cubes were a little stiff and I've had better Tikka Masala sauce.  The Eggplant dish I cared for the least. It was pretty ordinary with flavor.  The naan was awesome it made up for any deficiencies in the flavors of the dishes. Usually it's the other way around, where the entrees should shine.  The naan had a slight crisp on the outside,  moist interior and good flavor.  The Mango lassi was decent.
The restaurant itself was dim, dated and quiet.  Service was just ok. Prices were standard for Indian restaurants.  I wasn't happy when I asked the waiter to take home some leftover food and I was handed the containers and the bag to do it myself.  First of all it wasn't busy,  and second of all its not a counter service restaurant.
Didn't try any of the meat dishes,  especially that crab dish a bunch of reviews were raving about,  I'll definitely will come back,  but for now Kochi is not one the better choices of the Indian restaurants that are near me.
