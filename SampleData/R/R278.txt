Awesome place that we ran into last month. Owner explained us the menu thoroughly. Its a different food delicacy all together. Please don't order chicken tikka masala and compare it with the best one you had. Go with the owner or their servers selection. You can't go wrong. They will adjust the spice level according to your taste. The owner actually got some extra curry from his kitchen just to make us try different level of spices. If we come back we are definitely going back to try other different things from the menu.
