My husband and I visited Kochi for the Onam Sadhya and we totally enjoyed the food experience. The food was very good in taste and matched closely with authentic Kerala cuisine. It did a good job in satisfying our craving for malabar meals. Special mention to the payasams!
Was definitely worth the money.
