What can I say I've been coming here for quite awhile and their food is still my favorite.  Hey I have tried numerous other places and they all fall short not to mention the awesome customer service. Lol. I have not had a bad unimpressive dish here...yet. Today I stopped in for lunch since I haven't been their in quite awhile. What a treat the chef missed me. Lmao. I ordered the mysore masala dosa which was inspired by yelper Vince S.  Now I must say I over ordered again but I think I do that unconsciously so I can have leftovers. The dosa was sooo good, but a tad greasy. The flavors were delicious. I couldn't decide which sauce I liked the most. Of course I ordered the Gobi 65 bc duh. I don't even have to tell them anymore how spicy I want it they already know. That's awesome. Now I ordered chicken saagwala again which is still flavorful, but Alas I couldn't finish it. But I definitely had to make room for my beet root. Although I was seriously stuffed, wish I had worn stretch pants. Lol. I ordered my beet root and of course I also get that and kheer still divinely warm. Omg..i was switching between the two it was a crack frenzy. Uuughhh..definitely give them a try and tell them Tara sent you..you won't be disappointed..seriously
