We came in on a Friday night and waited 20 mins to be seated which was not an issue, but waited 25 mins for a dosa which is unacceptable.  Thankfully the masala dosa was tasty and held us over until our main courses which was served 15 mins later. Overall, we enjoyed the very spicy food but in the future we would order to-go instead of sitting in the restaurant.
