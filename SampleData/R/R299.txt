It is not so common to find restaurants that serve authentic Kerala food. After hearing about Kochi India cuisine from our friends, my husband and I really wanted to try it. On our recent trip from Philly to NJ, we went to this restaurant.
We tried puttu-kadala, idiyappam-veg stew, egg plant kozhambu and vegetable biriyani. All the dishes were prepared well, and were really tasty! We had asked them to make things spicy, I think the kozhambu and biriyani were pretty spicy, the kadala curry and stew were milder but very flavorful and unique.
The restaurant has an elegant ambience, friendly staff and service is great too. My only complaint is that the portion sizes are not big, just enough.. Would have loved it if there were any leftovers of the amazing food.
