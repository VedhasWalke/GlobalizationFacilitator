Good service, good food. Standard Indian fare, but I must say they cook their meat very well. I had lamb chops, my partner had a chicken dish, and both were extremely tender and delicious.
We started with samosas, which were enormous, and though they weren't the best samosas I've had, they were certainly above average. We also had the 'chicken Lollypops' which were a bit greasy, but tasted good.
The sauces are a bit lacking- the entree dish, the raita, and the chutni were all just 'meh.' But overall a pleasant surprise to find this place, especially considering the less-than ideal location.
