A dining room that's mostly full of South Asian clientele represents good tidings for any Indian dining experience. Such was the case with a recent visit to Kochi, a somewhat low key spot with pretty exciting South and North Indian fare in East Windsor.
Our party started off with the Gobi 65 (that's spiced, battered, and fried cauliflower) which, while small in portion, brought a lot of flavor in terms of a pungently spicy, chewy batter that still possessed a light crispness. We ended up sampling three main courses from Kochi's menu, which mostly focuses on South Indian fare. My fish curry offered tender fish in a lively sauce flavored with tamarind, chili, and a touch of coconut. The curry lacked balance in that the tamarind component kept the dish a little too assertively sour and cloying sweet, but it still possessed enough taste to satisfy.
Kochi's chicken curry, in contrast, shone. This dish's spice profile is rather unique relative to the norm, and this gravy nailed the harmony between warm, almost sweet spices, a good dose of piquancy, and tender chunks of chicken. The cooks at Kochi executed a mysore masala dosa well, as it boasted a decent amount of heft while maintaining a crisp exterior. Accompaniments to the dosa were more flavorful than usual.
Naans were pedestrian; the gossamer thin, multi-layered Malabar paratha is the bread of choice here (think a lighter, more flaky roti canai). Service at Kochi can run slow, but is helpful and friendly. Prices are de rigeur for higher-end Indian. For some unique flavor combinations that are normally relegated to home-cooking in America, definitely check out Kochi.
