This is perhaps the best south Indian cuisine you'll find in New Jersey. And that's saying a lot.
While all of the food is great, I highly recommend you order Keralite food. I've always found the staff exceptionally helpful with recommendations.
The kappa meen fish curry is to die for. I also highly recommend the coconut pepper chicken, the tamarind egg plant and coconut okra.
Remember to specify your spice tolerance.
The beet root halwa, and Kerala halwa are life changing.
Service is excellent, so please take advantage by asking for suggestions.
Also. BYOB.
