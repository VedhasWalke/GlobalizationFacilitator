Being a Malayali, I was very happy to see that there is FINALLY  a place that serves Kerala food!  My expectations were high obviously but I was pleasantly surprised that they actually met them!  The food tasted just like home-cooked Kerala food- terrific!  The service was nice too.  Prices are reasonable- I hope they would make weekend buffets soon!  
They can definitely improve on the wait time but it is a new restaurant and I know they will eventually.  The food is definitely worth the wait!
I hope more people knows about this place, and support it because I sure as heck don't want it to EVER go out of business!
