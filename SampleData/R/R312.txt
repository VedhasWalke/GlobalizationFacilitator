I don't even know where to start.  If you're from South India and are looking for some home cooked dosas, fish curry & tapioca, putt, idlis, and all that yummy stuff your mom made - and you're not going to settle for another americanized north indian run of the mill indian restaurant, then you need to hit this joint.  And hit it hard.  I want to make a trip back to the area just to have another go at this place.  Purees and Chapatis and..... (I could go one but I'm starting to salivate).
BTW - the place if BYOB.  Enjoy!
