Really great Indian! Nice service and a good size menu at good prices! Suitable for vegetarian, parties, kids, families, etc. there are bathrooms in the back, the only reason this is 4stars and not 5 is because the ambiance isn't the best, but definitely not the worst either! The butter chicken sauce is sort of bland but the tikka masala sauce is the star! THe veggie korma had lots of variety and was very good, although next time I'll go spicier. The eggplant in it was amazing! It was somehow creamy and next time I'll try the eggplant curry or dish based around the eggplant!
