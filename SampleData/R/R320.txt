Very decent kerala food. Visited several times. Attirachi ularthiyathu(goat appetizer) is great.
Malabar paratha with nattu kozhi masala is best. But the nattu kozhi may not be available all the time and also takes quite a while to make but it tastes good. If not can go for kochi special chicken curry.
Their fish wrapped in banana leaf is good...authentic. But Not everyone might like the banana leaf taste with the fish (like my cousins)
Puttu, idiyappam,chicken biriyani(with raisins) were okay.
I couldnt try the desserts as everytime i order one that i feel like eating  that day... it wouldnt be available!
Suggestion/request for the restaurant: please wash your blue glassesproperly.
