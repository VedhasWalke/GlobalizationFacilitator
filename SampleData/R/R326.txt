Awesome place for Kerala style / Chettinad food. Contrary to a few other reviewers, I'd give the rasam and seafood soup a miss - both were not even ordinary in my book and took up space before a great main course! Chemeen Theeyal (shrimp in a spicy coconut masala) was a yummy starter, but I wished I'd ordered it with the main course. Goat Varutharacha (spices with coconut masala) was great, as was the eggplant kozhambu (tangy tamarind based masala). Appams and Kerala parothas were good too. The Meen Pollichatu (whole fish smeared in Spices and roasted in a banana leaf) however, was easily the show stopper. Loved our meal.
The flipside? Of course there IS one or more, depending on how picky you are) : located in a strip mall, very basic seating and yet overpriced. Don't mind paying for the quality of food though. We seem to have gone at "off season" for them - didn't see the owner like so many reviewers have mentioned and only 2 tables including ours was occupied. We had loads of fruit flies for company. Must add that the servers apologized and tried to look graceful as they waved one of those electric bug killing contraptions and fried a few of them with ominous sizzling sounds! :)
