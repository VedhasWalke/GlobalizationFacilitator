Went back in DEC 2016 after moving a year ago and the food is as good as it ever was! The interior decor is much more refined and cozy. I'll say it again - not only the best Indian food I've ever had, but some of the best food period. I really can't say it enough. If you're nearby, RUN here now. Order anything. Anything at all. You'll thank me after.
