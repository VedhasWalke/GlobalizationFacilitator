BEST Indian restaurant. Used to come all the time when I lived in Hightstown and since moving to Philly I haven't found anything nearly as good. Often drive from Philly just to come to this spot.
Owner is really lovely and accommodating, food is perfectly spicy and fresh--no extra oil or grease!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
