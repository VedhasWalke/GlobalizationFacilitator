Kochi is hands down one of the best Indian Restaurants I have been to, esp. in the central Nj region. Kochi provides a complete Indian culinary experience by offering Northern and Southern cuisine that are so flavorful and especially well balanced.
Kochi's speciality as it's name suggests is with Kerala style cuisine. They offer specialities that I can attest to are better than what you can even get in Kerala! They have a wide variety and especially great seafood. They will also make items on request that are not on the menu.
I've been there many times and always have been impressed. Recently I had ordered catering from them for 75 people and the food quality was superb. Thomas and Mathew are true professionals and passionate about customer service and your experience.
Highly recommended in all regards.
