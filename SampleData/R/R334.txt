I visited this place with my family this weekend and loved the food and ambience. In appetizers, we tried Gobi Manchurian. The spice level was great and the sauces were well done. They did an excellent job explaining about ingredients and spice level for you to make right choices. We also tried Tandoori Chicken platter which was yummy as well. Specially, the chicken marinated in yogurt was pretty tender & juicy.
In the main course, we tried the Okra Masala on chef's recommendation. We were pleasantly surprised as this was a different variety than I expected or have tasted before. That was certainly something new we have tried in this trip. I recommend this place if you are into good Indian food.
