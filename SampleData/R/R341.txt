I've had the opportunity to visit India a few times.  The biggest difference I have noticed between Indian dishes there and in the U.S. is that spices there always have a fresher taste to them.  Kochi is the first u.s. Indian restaurant I've been to where everything tasted just as fresh as in India.  
They also had a number of items not typically found in u.s. Indian restaurants, like dosas, and the homemade desserts and ice cream are excellent.
