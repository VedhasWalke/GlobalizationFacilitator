In 14 years living in NYC, I haven't eaten Indian food that well-prepared, with that outstanding a spice combination and a fresh-herbed flavor profile.  Just amazing, across the board.  
On a trip through NJ with my family, we were so lucky to find Kochi, and I'm writing this with a belly full of it.  We ordered the boneless goat appetizer, the Attirachi Curry, Shrim Milagu Curry, and an  off-menu turkey dish served Varutharachathu.
And we tried all the deserts- the carrot halwa being my favorite by far.
We ordered all the Kerela dishes, recommended by our host, a very cool friendly South Indian who could speak at length about the spice routes - and the greek, roman, and egyptian archaeology in his state.
We asked to meet the chef, a super soft spoken guy named Mathew, also from Kerela, who we thanked like crazy for an amazing night of great food.
