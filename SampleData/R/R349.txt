Delicious food. I will say though, I ordered a mild chicken tikka masala and it was way more on the spicy side. We also ordered the garlic naan and chicken vindaloo. Everything was delicious. We had leftovers and loved it even more the next day! We ordered over the phone and came in to pick it up. The food wasn't ready at that point so we waited until it was. in the meantime, the gentleman manning the cashier walked over to us and handed us a smoothie like mango drink while we waited. I love proper customer service! Would definitely come again.
