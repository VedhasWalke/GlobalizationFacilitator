I usually go to the Indian Grill in Manalapan, wanted to try a different place. And I must say it was very delicious! They have the best onion kulcha here, it's my favorite. The carrot halwa I think it's called a dessert item was so tasty. I was happy with the service as well the man was very attentive.
