Yes. The baked fish was exactly as expected. Pretty spectacular. It's a Pomfret fish - which is a delicacy for coastal folks. The pepper chicken was very good too. Gobi 65 appetizer- a little underwhelming. But overall a great experience. Best to come in a little early for dinner. Place gets filled out pretty fast during the weekend.
