My family decided to have Thanksgiving dinner on Friday since people were arriving and traveling on the actual holiday. My uncle called Kochi as a result to make a dinner reservation for Thanksgiving day. They said they would be closed, but after learning we had a party of 25, said they would stay open just for us. I thought this was really awesome of them considering it was a holiday and despite working late, the waiters were all still fantastic.
It is BYOB so we brought a bunch of wine and they made sure our glasses were never empty. The food also seemed to constantly be flowing. I cant remember exactly what we ate but there was some excellent chicken and other appetizers. Main dishes included some kind of taro dish, fish curry, chicken curry, lamb chops, crab legs in curry, lobster,  rice, an assortment of bread (naan and paratha and roti), and fish. My favorites were the crab legs which had one of the best curries/gravy I have ever tasted and the lamb chops which were cooked and seasoned to perfection. They then brought out trays with 4 desserts- ice cream, some kind of custard, gulab jamun, and halwa. As mentioned previously, service was really great. They asked us if there were any other dishes we wanted and made sure to clear out table instantly when we finished something. There were a few leftovers which were packed up nicely for us as well.
It was a great meal as well as a nice experience. Not a lot of restaurants serve Kerala and Chettinad dishes so everyone really enjoyed the uniqueness of the food. Prices were also super reasonable- I am not positive but the feast we had came out to $35-40 per person. Kind of a bargain considering how much food there was as well as the vast variety of meat and seafood.
It is kind of an unassuming restaurant in a somewhat random location but I definitely encourage people to try Kochi for something unique and very delicious!
