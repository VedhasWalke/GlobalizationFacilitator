Last night a group of us celebrated my husband's recent U. S citizenship, and new found ability to vote on November 7th at Kochi Restaurant.  The food was truly delicious and fresh, from appetizer to desert!  The wait time was appropriate and the service excellent. Madhu was more than attentive and his advice re:which vegetarian dishes to order was perfect.  Many thanks  to Kochi and Madhu for contributing to a wonderful evening and dinner!
