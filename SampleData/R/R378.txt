The food was sup par at best. Very greasy and the naan bread was burnt. They told me my order would be ready for pick up in 35 minutes and was not ready until almost an hour. I had to inquire twice when my food would be out. I actually left and drove away, then was called about my order being ready. An overall terrible experience. Cross Culture in Princeton makes this place look like McDonald's. A first and a last for me. Stay away!
