We went with a group of 9 on a Saturday night and had a superb meal with friendly and top notch service.  Several of our group had lived in London and hadn't had great Indian food since moving back to the U.S.; until eating here.  The dosas were delectable, crisp, hot delicious with wonderful and creative chutneys and sauces.  This is not your tired, out of the jar stuff.  They are handmade with fresh and vibrant spices.  Everything we had was spiced as requested; those who wanted hot got it just the way they wanted and the "less heat" versions did not mean bland.  The complex spices were still present even without the heat.
Don't miss the goat curry, the table's favorite, but the okra curry, eggplant curry and the tandoori breads rocked it as well.  I know, who orders dessert in an Indian  restaurant?  You should here. They served us a dessert sampler plate that blew us away.  
The service was awesome, our waiter double checked with the kitchen in every order to make sure our gluten free friend stayed gluten free while she ate.  He helped us choose quantities which is hard with a large group and didn't let us order too much or too little.  Great place and not to be missed!
