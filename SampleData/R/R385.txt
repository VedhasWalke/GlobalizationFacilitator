Delicious Indian food!  My sister was visitng from Florida and wanted really good Indian food.  I read the reviews and took her here. We loved it!  I had the Kozhi Varutharachathu (Chicken pieces cooked with roasted coconut and fresh spices)which was amazing!! The people at the restaurant explained the dishes to us, and the service was 5 star!!!  I can't wait to go back!
