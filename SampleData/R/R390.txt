Pricey! Pricey!! Pricey!!! A highly priced restaurant for average quality food and bad service. I tried this restaurant after reading couple of reviews from users hoping that my experience would perhaps be more positive and giving the benefit of doubt to the restaurant. Unfortunately I experienced a terribly negative experience.
You will be paying premium prices for mediocre food, served on fancy dishes.
I also noticed that most raving reviews on Yelp regarding this establishment are from non-Indians.  Could it be that the ethnic folks have more stringent standards?
Couple of things to bear in mind:
- I would caution anyone who goes there to be aware of the high price items they try to sell you on, which invariably happens to be seafood, or anything they mention as specials of the day.
- service is not that great. I had pointed out "hair", yes hair, on one of the bread "naan" items brought straight from the kitchen. The Manager didn't even bother to take the price off that item. I walked away feeling it was my fault to have ordered the "naan".  
- the north Indian food items tasted much better than the Kerala, and South Indian dishes, making me wonder what was indeed their specialty - North Indian or South Indian (Kerala)?  They call themselves "Kochi" after the South Indian coastal town of Cochin.
I don't mind paying the price if my experience was worth it, but unfortunately it wasn't. I couldn't justify how the food tasted, or the service, and lastly the price.
