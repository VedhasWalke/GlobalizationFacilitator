This is a Central Kerala themed menu with a few standard North Indian dishes. The service is fast and friendly. Our server was from Andra but seemed to know his way around the menu. The Chef has toned down spices to appeal for the American taste buds, which creates the opp for some interesting flavors thought I would not say the food was great. Interesting and good for a change.  I am also very surprised that there is no steak on the menu. Beef is a core kerala dish, and if Kochi is not serving beef then it would be quite a disappointment.
