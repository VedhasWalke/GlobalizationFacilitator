We were just in town for the day and while driving home we decided to stop by at Crown of India for dinner. We ended up getting the the dinner for 2 option. This had so many different courses and they were all delicious. The service was great and we were able to take a lot of food to go because we were stuffed by the main course. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!
