Was driving through NJ when saw this restaurant. Being a native to Kerala, really wanted to try some authentic Kerala food. Save a few restaurants in NY, there are very few Kerala cuisine in US. Most of the restaurants catering to the other south Indian cuisines. Was delightfully surprised to find a restaurant that can make a difference. Not like most of the Indian restaurants in the area.
I had my parents with me as well, who are more well versed with Kerala cuisine. Had the chemeen ularthiyathu and the  attirachi ullarthiyathu as appetizers. The flavors were really nice and quite authentic. The meen pollichathu was tasty with all the masala having thoroughly caught in the fish. The presentation of the fish was awesome as well.
The choice of menu was really nice. Presentation and ambience also excellent, I wish we had a branch opening in Virginia as well. I also would try to catch their buffet next time I am in the region. The staff, Chef Mathew and Thomas are quite attentive and gave more insight on to some of these items I have been having for a while. Really beats having to fly to Kerala for a taste of Kochi food.
