We had dinner at Kochi yesterday and we were a group of 13. I would say it was one of the best dinners we had in recent times.  Both veg and non-veg items were all splendid. The chicken lollipops, meen polichathu, shrimp mulagu curry, malabar meen curry and the garlic kuzhambu were the highlights. Everyone of us thoroughly enjoyed. Kudos to the chef Matthew and his team as they set the bar high. Check out Kochi for authentic Kerala special cuisine and we surely plan to go again!
