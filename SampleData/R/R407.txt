The shrimp-coconut appetizer is fantastic! The Mango Lassi is decent. The Malabar Paratha is as good as any you will get in Kerala. The fish curry we got was slightly tangier than we would have liked it to be, but that was the way it should have been and we probably made a wrong choice ordering that. It was tasty, none the less. Definitely will visit again and try other things on their pretty vast menu.
The service is very good. The chef/owner is kind enough to ask how the food is etc. The decor is simple (it is in a strip mall) but that shouldn't put anyone off from visiting!
