This was a fantastic introduction to Indian food. My bf and I had the chicken lollipop app, chicken tikka masalla and kochi special curry with a side of garlic naan.  I loved it. The service was fantastic as well. We did not realize the time of day, but apparently we wandered in about 15 minutes before close. There wasn't any mention of it by the manager/owner until the end of the meal when we asked about the restaurant hours. He was incredibly gracious and provided us with great recommendations.  I can't wait to try the buffet during the week
