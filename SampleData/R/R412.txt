I was here for thanksgiving weekend dinner  one of our family friend had recommended this restaurant for excellent Kerala n chettinad cuisine which I hardly find in nj n ny. So we were here with the party of 4 we tried their seafood soup kochi stir fried chicken n chk lollipop which lived up to expectation but their main course which we Fish wrapped in banana leaf  which you wont find in usa i guarantee. Stir fried shrimp was loved by all of my friends Malabar fish curry was well done with perfect spice which goes so well with white rice. It was perfectly ended with their Kerala halwa. Service was excellent too  must recommended place give it a try wont regret at all.
