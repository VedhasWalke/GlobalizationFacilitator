After reading all the good reviews my expectations were high. We ordered a vegetable biryani, masala dosa and a eggplant kuzumbu. The biryani was dry and excessively spicy but was probably the better of 3 dishes we ordered. Eggplant Kuzumbu was well presented, but I felt the portion size was too less and the gravy had a little bit of tomato ketchup flavor to it. Masala dosa was downright bad - very thin, dry and was actually slightly sweet for some strange reason. Also I hate it when whole wheat roti looks quite white. So not much to talk about..perhaps this is a better place for non-vegetarian food.
