Amazing food !  Not just saying this.
The place is new ( abt 5 months) and was skeptical initially.
We ordered some very traditional fare to see how the quality measured up.
- Puttu & Kadala curry
- Kappam Fish curry
- Aapam & Mutta ( egg) Curry
- Aapam & Mutta ( egg) Roast
The last two were not even on the menu and they made it.
The portion sizes were perfect and every one of the above dishes was brilliant.
The fish curry had an authentic spicy feel ( not too much or too little ) just perfectly spicy.  
Nice trendy decor and very friendly service oriented staff.
Can see several trips  the near future !
