The first time we came here was around the time they first opened. The owner was there and gave us an interesting lesson about India and the regional foods. I got the chicken tikka masala and the naan. Ive had this dish in many other places and I have to say, their version is one of the better ones. I can't remember what my family members got but no one was disappointed in what they ordered. We have been here at least 3 times since the first time and we will come back again.
