Decent place .. I was back in Hamilton in 2013 when I think this place started and surprised to see it is still there given that the previous owners of this place always went out of business in less than a year or so. It does have few menu items from Kerala which is not there in any other place around in NJ so definitely a must try for a foodie. Taste wise also it is not bad and overall it is a good place!
