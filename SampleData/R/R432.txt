Just had our lunch here. The 1st thing we liked is how courteous and friendly the staff was. Not only they were prompt with getting us seated and taking our order but throughout our lunch they checked on us. Secondly food was awesome. We had Mysore Masala Dosa, Tomato Rasam, Chicken Lollipop, Idli and Beetroot Halwa. The Chicken Lollipop were tender and succulent to the bone. Our 3 year old who is a picky eater enjoyed the Chicken and Idli a lot. And for the first time there wasn't any fuss or drama while eating. Tomato Rasam had the right amount of spice and was delicious. Beetroot Halwa, what can i say about it. It was mind blowing. We couldn't believe beetroot can be so awesomely tasty. You got to try that to believe. It is quite some time we have had good South Indian food. We love the cusine and this place made us fall in love all over again with the cusine. Keep up the good work Kochi. And we will be back. -A very satisfied Mohapatra Family
