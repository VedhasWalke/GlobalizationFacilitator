Decent and authentic South-Indian food. A small place in an unappealing strip-mall. I had the hoppers, fish curry and Kochi's chicken curry. All were tasty. The fish was not exactly tender, but I didn't mind, since the curry was overal very flavorful and very much like what I learned to cook when I was in Kochi.
