WORTH THE CALORIES
I would describe this place as totally worth the price and calories. And my opinion is to try! this! place! If you want true indian taste despite the 3.5 stars.
We went to this place cuz this chain is super famous in Chennai, and we happen to be in this area, so...... yeah we gave it a whirl.
We ordered pongal and vada, special meal, and combo 1.
Let's start with the pongal. It is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I loved it as a non indian person, my boyfriend loved it and he's from Chennai, we enjoyed it so much!!!! Vada on the other side is so so, could be better definitely. Sambar and chutney also decent, love love love.
As for the combo 1, masala dosa is good! Potato is the bomb. Seriously I had major fun with the potato!!!! Everything else is decent, sweet is fantastic, and I was very full after combo 1. So portion is no problem if you love your food a lot like me.
The special meal! Goddamn! I was truly blown as a foreigner, excuse me here, but probably homely for indian ppl (I guess), I loved the korma, appalam, poori, and the sambar soooo much! The potato in there is even better than the potato in masala dosa. I learned that not everyone loves korma, but yo girl here is definitely a korma kinda girl. The sweet is malai, and it's satisfying.
Mango lassi is very lassiy so yeah, it's perfect.
All in all, recommend, recommend, recommend. If you are here to search some of the true taste of south India, and you don't care that much about anything else, yas. However if you are here for the experience, then don't. I personally think service isn't their strong suit. And the decor is not the best. I have seen people saying it's not good cuz of rude staff and all, for me they are very nice to us, always willing to help, probably cuz I'm with an India person, so it's really about what you value more.
