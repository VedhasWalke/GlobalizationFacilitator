Definitely do yourself a favor and go here for amazing dosa and Chole bhatura! There's such a wide selection of dosas that you can't go wrong. Saravana Bhavan is a South Indian girl's ( aka me) favorite restaurant because they serve all the classics from a classic masala dosa with sambar to vada& chutney. Will definitely keep coming back. Nothing but good things to say!
