I would have rated this place more if not for the bad service. Food was fine but, there was no place inside. So we had to sit out. The place outside isn't very clean and it's right by the street.. with the hustling roads of New York City, it's traffic,  the food takes a back seat.
I would only recommend this place to anyone,
1. if you're desperate to have Indian food.
2. If you have 2-3 hrs spare time.
