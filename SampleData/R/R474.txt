A long story, but be patient!
This particular Saravana Bhavan has come a long way. We first tried it in 2016, and hated it. The folks running the place had no idea about South Indian food. I distinctly remember ordering Parotta kurma and sending it back in twice and my kids not even finishing their dosai due to the terrible taste. Chutneys were horrendous.
We moved on to the Saravana Bhavan in Franklin Park. Definitely much better food but they quick closed down to our disappointment.
After two long years, we tried this Saravana again a couple of months back. Were we wow-ed or what!
They have made a complete turn around. Chutneys are sambar - the backbone of South Indian food - are amazing. Although the chutneys are quite inconsistent. But great nevertheless. Dosai, thali, mini meals - all excellent.
No more driving to A2B for us
