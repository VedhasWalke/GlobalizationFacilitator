okay. MAYBE it's because I come here with my family a lot, and this is like our staple comfort food restaurant in town or MAYBE it's because I love South Indian food generally, but I don't understand why they deserve two stars?!? People!! The sambhar is better than some places in Edison, the chutneys are fresh (albeit on weekends, but who goes here on a Tues lol), and the masala chai/filter coffee is as real as it gets-silver cups and all. They have the most South Indian food options among any other south indian restaurants in central jersey and they even have JAIN effin curries and sambhar. count your blessings, like this never happens.
I will concede, though, service could probably be a little faster and more organized. imo, there should probably be a mechanism to reserve tables too, since I've seen people waiting to be seated and plenty of open seats. Also, train your staff!! My server didn't understand 3 of my orders and it's just a big waste of time honestly.
