Situation: In an attempt to avoid the Friday night lines at some of our usual favourite Indian restaurants, the fam and I decided to try something new. We ordered three dishes (a cheese dosa, Combo-1, Medhu Vasa, and a mango lassi. Our bill came out $32 before tax and tip.
PROS
-Most of the dishes require that you eat with your hands, which can be a fun experience.
CONS
-Poor menu selection: They don't offer any of the classic dishes you'll find in traditional Indian cuisine such as paneers, biryanis, or curries. Very disappointing.
-So-so food. The food didn't taste horrible, but it was not very tasty or memorable. Rather blah, in my opinion. At the very best, I can say that at least it was served fresh and hot.
-Poor ambience: The food is served on metal plates with little compartments, reminiscent of a soup kitchen or prison. The tables and chairs were scratched up and the water pitchers were all mismatched and grungy-looking.
-Lackluster service: Our server did the bare minimum.
-Bad pricing: You'd think after all that badness it'd be dirt cheap. All the portions were very small (although the bread made them appear large when served) and unsatisfying. They were closer to appetizers than entrees. The mango lassi was $6 for a very small cup, maybe 6 oz. or so.
In a nutshell...
Very disappointed. Genuinely the worse Indian restaurant I have ever been to, and I have been to a variety of them, from upscale to fast food. I would not return, even if paid to do so.
