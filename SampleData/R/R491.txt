The quality of food in this restaurant used to be amazing when it opened but has substantially deteriorated over last 12 months or so.
I've seen a gradual drop in the make and taste of a classic like Millagaipodi Masala Dosa; yesterday it was so tasteless and I had to send it back. Sambhar served was cold and horrible; a South Indian restaurant which can't serve a good sambhar ought to be out of business. Finally, the dessert classic like Badam halwa was equally disappointing. It seemed they took this out of freezer and microwaved before serving leading to uneven temperature and staleness from the frozen ghee/oil.
I'd not be going back to this location.
