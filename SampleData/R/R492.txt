Their food is highly inconsistent. We visited Saravana yesterday with our parents and the entire  experience was very forgettable. All the Dosa's were super soggy and soft. Their medu vada's were soft and spongy and definitely refried.
My father ordered parrota which comes with 2 curries. One of the curry was chana masala, probably the worst of the lot. The chick peas weren't cooked at all and completely hard.
In the end I discussed it with the manager and he removed just one order of medu vada from our check.
A complete waste of time and money. Avoid it and go to Dosai place down the road.
