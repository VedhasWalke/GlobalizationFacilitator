I had a nice experience, the servers were attentive and the food came out pretty quickly. I got the cheese dosa which I dipped into the 3 difference sauces and had the small soup. Its perfect for vegetarians and the food wasn't bad, it wasn't as greasy as I thought. It reminded me of being in a cafeteria because the food came in metal food trays. There's parking, but during lunchtime you might end up parking a little far due to the amount of people who go to the compound since it's got some other restaurants.
