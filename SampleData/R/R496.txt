The reviews are somewhat shocking! This is one of my all time favorite so-Indian joints and is known to be quite authentic compared to other Indian restaurants in central NJ. The dishes can be inconsistent - some days they will slightly vary in ingredients and be spicier than other days. The food seems to be the freshest on the weekends. Still, the food is usually pretty amazing...!
Overall, the environment is definitely casual and the service is relaxed but someone is always willing to help you with whatever you need. All of the staff is friendly.
If you went and had a bad experience, I would consider giving them another chance.
