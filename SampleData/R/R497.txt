I had food in other Sarvana Bhavan, like one in Edison. Though the ambience and food of the Edison one was excellent, this one is really bad. I took my family for dinner couple of weeks back. I took a Thali and it was horrible - I could eat only the half of the sabjis. My wife and son took Masala Dosa. Though the dosas looked big, the quality was not good. It is not at all value for money.
