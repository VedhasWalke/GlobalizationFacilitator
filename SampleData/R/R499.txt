We had dinner here on Friday and the woman at the front desk was downright rude. First when we wanted to sit at a quiet corner booth, she reluctantly let us. We waited quite a bit before someone came to take the order. Then before we had finished our dinner, she plopped the bill in the middle of the table as a signal for us to finish eating asap. Then when that did not work, she asked us to pay the bill and started coming to the table every 2 minutes.
This woman's behavior was appalling , she even started shouting at us  when we asked her why she was giving us the bill when clearly we were not done. Her explanation - " It's Friday and you took that 4 seat table." Let her keep her precious table and restaurant to herself!!! Granted it was a busy night for them but this is not the way to treat customers! Never ever going back.
And the food is just ok. Nothing special . The Saravana in Edison has far better food and hygiene.
