Service was horrible and the floor manager was not ready to take any feedback rather started fighting back and that's not a service you expect after paying really good amount for your food. A simple coffee delivered after 30 minutes and after 5 reminders. It's definitely not a good place if we talk about the customer service and attitude of staff.
