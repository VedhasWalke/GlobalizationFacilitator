Worst $30 meal I ever had! Service was horrible, they were not pleasant or helpful in ordering. I asked for small plates and they brought two for our party of four. Everything we needed was met with a chilly response. I actually wondered if they were treating us badly because of our ethnicity.  There are multiple other Indian places in this area. Choose any other one over this one.
