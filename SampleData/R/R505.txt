I can only say so much without visiting other sarvana Bhawan's in NJ but the food is stale. Tried the onion dosa and it was salty and barely crispy and the sambar is old and barely any good. The famous Bismila bath looked like it was 2 days old and I had to ask for it to be hot as it was served cold. I can only expect so much coming on a Saturday afternoon. I've visited sarvana Bhawan in many places in Chennai, India and dubai but this is not acceptable. Sorry sarvana I'm not visiting you again in the US.
