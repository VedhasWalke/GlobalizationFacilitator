I liked the chilly bajji, onion dosa and poori at this place. The chilli bajjis are cryspy, but a little oily ( thats expected). The chutneys served along with the dosas tasted great, and this restaurant upholds the reputation of being 'Saravana Bhavan'.
If you want to enjoy dosas, idlis and a typical South Indian (vegetarian) cuisine, you could surely try this place out.
