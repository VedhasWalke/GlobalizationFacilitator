The food is average and so is the service . You will get the usual , one good thing is that they are consistent with the food. We go there for Thalis which are decent and different from what you would get at other places . A tad bit expensive as compared to other South Indian restaurants . The filter coffee is disappointing , you expect much better from a global chain like Saravana Bhavan. Try it if you are really craving for South Indian.
