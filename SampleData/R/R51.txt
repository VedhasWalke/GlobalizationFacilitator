This review is about their take-out. I got their paneer mumtaz, garlic naan, and mango lassi. I ordered medium spicy for the paneer, and it was on the spicier side but I like that. The taste was delicious and they were generous with the paneer cubes! The garlic naan was tasty, as was the mango lassi. I was very happy with my order and I'll definitely order from them again next time I'm craving Indian.
