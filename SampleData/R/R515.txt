Have been here a few times with mixed results. Usually got channa bhatura which is chick peas and puff bread. Spice level was always fine. I'm Indian l, grew up eating spicy food with no issues. Ordered take out of it tonight and it would have been less hot if I just ate some burning matches. When I called about it I was hung up on and then rudely talked down to. I don't need this from a restaurant to be treated like trash. They won't be getting a second chance and I'm calling their corporate head quarters about how I was treated. Be warned. Would love to hear from a manager about the hostess
