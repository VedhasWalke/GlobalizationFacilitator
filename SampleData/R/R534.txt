We have been there twice so far.  The first time, it was a really good experience, the second time, not so much, probably due to our selections.  The first time, the dosas were crisp, the chutneys relatively fresh (loved the coconut chutney).  My kid loved the rava khichdi (usually we have trouble getting anything into him).  The second time around, my BH did the mistake of ordering the Mysore masala dosa - the dosa was limp, the masala itself tasted old.  The khichdi my kid loved the first time, was way too spicy even for our taste this time.  My oothappam was raw in places too, this, even after it being a slow night.  
That said, I am willing to give it one more shot, but at the same time I am going to try the Myilai Masalai that opened in Hamilton.  For one thing, I love the fact that there are plenty of South Indian options in and around my place now, and I don't have to go to Oak Tree road (god, I hate that place!!). It remains to be seen as to how many of these are going to last..
