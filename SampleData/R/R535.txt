This place sucks big time! If this is the standard of their whole chain of restaurants, I'm really sorry for them. Once I ate at their Edison location (Oak Tree Road), and everything was so outrageously salty, I never went back. When they opened in West Windsor, I thought, maybe I can give them another chance. Boy, was I wrong.
The menu is VERY limited with few choices, and ALL of them, way pricier than you would expect, for no apparent reason. The dosas came out limp, flattened, very dry, and were not filling. The bottom of the dosas stuck to our plates, which was a total turn-off. The chutneys were all EXTRA hot (except, to be fair, the tomato chutney). The owner lady strutted aggressively around the entire hall exerting people to get their $5 mango lassi (exorbitantly priced), and was visibly disappointed when people like us politely declined. I mean, WHO in their right mind pays $5 for a glass of mango lassi??? They also had something called Masala Milk, which was priced similarly! I mean these guys are trying to make a hole in your pocket without giving much in return! Service was so-so, and the only noticable energy spent was in pushing people to buy their highly priced drinks.
That's it! I'm not going back to another Saravana Bhavan again, no matter how many more restaurants they open around the globe!!!
