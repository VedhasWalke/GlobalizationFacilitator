I was at this place with my family and friends for lunching August 25th. There was only two other persons at one table.
We were seated and the waiter took our orders immediately. Service was faster than expected but then again we were the only ones.
The rava dosas that most of us ordered were delicious. We ordered some vandas too. They were dense and too heavy. Sambar was mediocre at best,chutneys were just ok. Kaima idilli was tasty. We all liked it.
I am giving two stars not because the food but because of the lack of hygeine and the lack of concern by the staff.
As we were close to finishing our lunch we noticed water dripping from the ceiling. It was a continuous heavy drip that we could hear. It was just in front of us and it was dripping on cups,utensils etc that were stacked for serving. We noticed the manager or the main guy there looking at the ceiling and not bothered either to move us to a different table or move the cups,plates etc. I asked him him about the leak and he just mumbled that they have to see whst it was. We all could see the ceiling at the leak heavily stained from previous leaks so we knew this was not  the first time.
None of us could believe this guy's attitude.
The restrooms were so filthy that we had to go to the coffee place next door for kids to use the restroom. The lack of cleanliness is something we don't tolerate in restaurants. We will never go back there again.
If this is how they are in their customer's presence I hate to think how careful they are inside where the food is prepared and stored. I am sure I don't want to know
