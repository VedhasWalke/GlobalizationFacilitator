This review is solely based on the food. Everything that we ordered turned out to be excellent! Very flavorful south Indian food. We ordered the rasam, bisibele bhath, channa batura, adai avial and onion chilli uthappam. Everything was delectable. However, service is very poor and needs a lot of improvement. They need to hire more wait staff.
