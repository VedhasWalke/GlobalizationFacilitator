I am curious as to whether the previous reviewer has actually visited this location in West Windsor. Saravana Bhavan is indeed a trusted brand for delicious and authentic vegetarian south Indian food, and I was delighted to see that there was a location here in N.J. Because of the reputation of Saravana Bhavan, we felt confident ordering food from this restaurant. Unfortunately, the food at this particular restaurant made me violently ill. We recently ordered takeout, and I made the mistake of ordering the mini meals. Without going into too much graphic detail, I was up all night vomiting, and slept on the bathroom floor because I was too ill to stand. I was very close to going to the ER. The food tasted fine, but it is clear that the rice I ate had been left out too long and was not prepared fresh. This is consistent with other reviewers who mentioned that they were concerned to see their food come out within 1 minute of ordering. Saravana Bhavan has diluted their brand by creating too many branches. TREAD CAREFULLY AT THIS RESTAURANT. (Side note: I was also unimpressed by the service when I ordered over the phone. The woman I spoke with was uncompromising when I asked if one of the dishes could be ordered less spicy for my mother-in-law who has a health condition. I understand that south Indian food is spicy, and I like it that way, but there is no need to be rude to or "school" customers in this regard. Instead, it might be helpful to suggest another dish that is less spicy.)
