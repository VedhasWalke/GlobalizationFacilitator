Unfortunately I have to change my review about the food. We went twice in one week because the first time we had a great experience. Second time was very disappointing. They had no Mysore masala dosa. So we ordered plain dosa and masala dosa. The dosa was served cold. Which I think is a cardinal sin. The chutney was ice cold. So probably was made the previous day. The sambar was okay.  Also ordered chole bhatura. It was the worst we have ever had. The chole was just seriously bad. All we could taste was garlic. It had no other flavour. Also chole bhatura is always served with onions and lime which was missing.... the server was nice.  He a need to realise were disappointed with the food but didn't say anything.
