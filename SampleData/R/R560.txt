This is what I have been looking for in this area for a long time. Good Indian food for a good price at a causal cafe style restaurant. Service was quick. Food was delicious. I tasted the lamb biryani, had the aloo papri chaat, a chicken tikka Kathi Roll, and Gulab jamuns. People with me also had masala dosas. They said they were great. Perfect place to visit for a snack or a quick meal and get great Indian food from every region without having to sit down at a formal restaurant. Looking forward to visiting again!
