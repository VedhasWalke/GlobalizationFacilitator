Cross Culture has delicious Indian food that can be cooked to the preferred spiciness.  Their online ordering is easy to use and totaled for you.  You pay when you order.  When we picked up the food, there was a table blocking entry to the restaurant but someone came out right away.  We provided our name and he gave us our food which was readily available.
The food was packed nicely and delicious!  Vegetarian Samosa, assorted Pakora, naan, chicken masala and chicken cashmere.  Yummy!
