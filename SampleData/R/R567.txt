Aug 2019, great tasting food, and service was good.  There are lots of tables and booths inside, and the place is very clean.  I ordered the Shrimp Nargisi that was delicious tasting, and the coconut sauce that the Shrimp was soaking in without the Egg.  Just cant put Shrimp and Egg together in my mind.   The Shrimp was fresh, and medium sized, and they give you around eight Shrimp.   My friend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, that she said was delicious.    We also ordered the Naan Bread that was freshly made.   All and all, I would come back here if I am ever in the area.
