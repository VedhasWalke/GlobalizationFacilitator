I came here seeking out good Indian food, and I found it! I read previous reviews saying the food was good, but the service wasn't great - this is absolutely true. The waiters don't seem to want you to be there, they are not very friendly and are somewhat impatient. They were attentive, just not very friendly. It was very dark inside too, beyond ~intimate~ lighting. They just didn't have the lights on for whatever reason. Also, they put a bottle of Pellegrino on each table hoping you'll open it so they can charge you for it... not my favorite tactic to try to make you spend more money.  Otherwise, the chicken biryani was delicious and the serving size was massive! Would definitely get that again! The mixed appetizer for two was the perfect size. The aloo gobi was a bit bland and I wouldn't get it again. Overall, I would come here for the biryani and not the service. With that mindset, I think it's a good experience
