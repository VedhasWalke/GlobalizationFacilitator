Delicious Indian cuisine even for lunch in a pleasantly decorated restaurant with terrific service and the staff that really cares.  
My new favorite lunch spot two blocks from where I work! Not sure why I haven't been here before. Very nicely and comfortably decorated restaurant on the smaller size in the Princeton shopping center strip mall on Harrison Street.
They serve the unleavened bread and rice with your meal which are extraordinary! The best bread I've had in an Indian restaurant to date!
They had either shrimp or seafood curry on the menu. I asked him to make it shrimp and seafood curry which they did. Wow absolutely delicious! If you love Indian food you've got to make it out here!
My friends both ordered the chicken tikka masala in a rich, creamy tomato sauce! They went to heaven right in front of me they loved every bite.
Now here's something that I've never seen before, they serve you so much food that if you have any of your main dish left over, they will not only pack it up for you but they will throw in extra bread and rice to make it a meal for when you get home!  In a sense getting two meals out of one, bachelors take note!   So hey that secures five stars in my book! Come here and tell me you don't agree!
Very highly recommended for excellent Indian food with terrific customer service.
