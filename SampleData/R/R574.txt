Tonight is my second time dining here and I will definitely be back. I am newer to Indian food (I usually get Chicken Tikka Masala anywhere), however I was excited to try new menu items here. We started with the stuffed/fried chili peppers  (I did not try as I do not care for spicy food), and the spiced pea/potato fritter (yummy with the plum sauce!) For dinner I had the Chicken Karahi mild and it was so  flavorful and delicious. You could really taste the garlic and ginger in the sauce. I will absolutely be back and the best part is that it is BYOB!
