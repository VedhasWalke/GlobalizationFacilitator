I was waiting for the day that my job ordered lunch from here again - and today was the day!
Now this review is strictly for takeout- and for the lunch chicken Tikka masala . I just love it so much . So delish that it is a 5 stars .
I don't eat Indian food much but this place is one of the best I've had as far as chicken tikka masala .
I've never been to the actual restaurant because we order and someone goes and gets it for us
