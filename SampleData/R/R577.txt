Got here about quarter til noon on a weekday and was barely ahead of the lunch crowd.  Collegue and I ordered two items off the lunch menu. Lamb korma and a paneer masala. The lunch includes naan, rice, and a pakora.
The pakora came out and was served with two types of chutney, cilantro mint and tamarind.  Pakora was piping hot and crisp while the chutneys were fresh and flavorful.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The lunch entrees came out shortly after. The paneer masala came with a side of dal makhani (savory mung beans). Fresh plain rice and naan were serve.
The paneer masala at cross culture is one of the creamiest sauces I've had with a paneer.  
While I thoroughly enjoyed everything, my Indian collegue said it was ok. I would go back to try other menu items.
Tip: you can let the waitstaff know your preference of spiciness.
