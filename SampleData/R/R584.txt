We love this place. We've been coming for years and keep coming back. Such flavorful food! We've tried multiple other Indian restaurants when cross Culture is closed and we're craving Indian but nothing comes even close. Even our toddler loves it! And the lunch special is a great deal! All the staff are super nice so the service is also great! So sad due to covid, it's closed at the moment. Looking forward to it re-opening!
