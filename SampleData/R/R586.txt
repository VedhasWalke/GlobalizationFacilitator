Use to be one of my favorite Indian restaurants...chicken tiki masala is really good.  Only reason for the two stars is because they raised the price a lot... use to be 12$ for lunch with nan and now they raised it to 17$ and nan is extra. Food is still great though but many other cheaper restaurants to go to for the same quality food.
