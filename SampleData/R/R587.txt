Underwhelming. Everything was fresh, but to say there was no discernible spice is pretty unbelievable given its ethnic Indian food. Chicken makhani was literally, chicken in a tomato cream sauce and no spice at all.  The garlic naan had no pieces of garlic and no resemblance to its taste either. Everything came out quickly, service was courteous, and the setting intimate. I just can't comprehend how incredibly bland this food was and how many people rave about this place being so great. It makes me wonder what their ethnic food experience really is.
