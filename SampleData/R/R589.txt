I ordered food from here. I ordered chicken tika misala and asked for medium spice. When I went home to eat it I ate the chicken mixed with the rice but the food was way to spicy. It was so spicy I couldn't even finish what I put in my plate. Water didn't help. It was so spicy that I felt it in my ears and five minutes my mouth is still burning. The food was not bad but they do not understand how much spice to put in there food. When I go back next time I will get little spice.
