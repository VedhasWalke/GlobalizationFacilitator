Is their food good?  Yes, but there is a plethora of excellent Indian choices in the area.  My main complaint is our treatment:
I called early in the week to see if coming at 9 on a Friday night would work since they close at 10.  They assured me that it would be fine, so I made the reservation for four.
We arrived and ordered by 9:15 and the food began to arrive about 10-15 minutes later. Completely reasonable.
At 10:05, the waiter came to our table.  One in the party was still actively eating, the other three of us had very recently put down our forks.  Without asking if we were done, the waiter came to the table, asked if we wanted boxes and proceeded to take our dishes and entrees.  The one of us still eating was made incredibly uncomfortable.
We were going to order dessert, but clearly that was not going to happen.
As we left (the check arrived and was handled with the utmost speed), we noticed that there were others still at their tables.
Had they told me on the phone when I called that coming that late would not work for them, I'd have been fine and this review would have a much different tone - after all, the food is good.  Being rushed through a celebratory meal after being assured all would be fine has left me with this - I will never return to this restaurant.
