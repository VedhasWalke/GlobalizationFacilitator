Slow service, and very underwhelming taste. The lentils dish was mostly filler, like onions and broth, as opposed to being a thick lentil dish. The chickpeas weren't spicy when they should have been, and the chicken wasn't the best consistency, and was rather bland. The naan bread wasn't hot, and the rice wasn't either.
The ambiance was alright, and it was clean, but if you want good Indian I would look elsewhere.
