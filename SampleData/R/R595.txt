I've been here a number of times for lunch.  I love the diverse lunch menu that gives the diner lots of options. My friend & I always choose one vegetarian dish and one chicken dish to share. Lunches come with a small basket of pakoras, ample bowl of rice, entrees in small bowls perfect for sharing along with a bowl of lentils & a basket of nice warm naan bread. There are two delicious chutneys on the table one coriander and one tamarind.
Service is excellent & the food is delicious. I think the cost for lunch is extremely reasonable. I look forward to many more great meals!
