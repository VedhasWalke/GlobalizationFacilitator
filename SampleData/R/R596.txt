Like other reviews have said, this place is amazing! I had no idea this existed in Princeton Shopping Center. I came here for lunch the other day. I had thought that there would be a lunch buffet, but it was Sunday, so maybe not.
I liked that there was a separate lunch menu. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. The chicken was delightful. It tasted like maybe it was seared first. The inside was very tender. There was an ample amount of meat in the Masala sauce.
The lunch special comes with a split pea or lentil soup along with pakoras, naan, and rice. Needless to say, I was very full and had enough leftover for another meal.
My boyfriend got the Chicken in the spinach sauce - I forget the name. I also recommend this one. I loved the creamed spinach.
We also got a mango lassi. I could tell they used real mangos. It was definitely one of the better mango lassi drinks I've had.
