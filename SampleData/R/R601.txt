Tried this place (and indian food) for the first time tonight - WOW!! I'd read about the lack of servers on yelp before going so I was preparing for that but we had NO problems. One of 3 servers was tending to us every 10 minutes or so - filling water, refilling rice, or just checking in. Very friendly. My bf ordered the chicken vindaloo but was worried about the spice, and our server made sure to tell him that it is about a 10 on the spicy scale normally, and offered to kick it down to a 5 or 6. It was still very spicy so be careful! But it was delicious. I had the chicken tikka masala and it was so yummy.. big tender hunks of meat and the sauce was perfectly flavored. We couldn't inhale the food fast enough, lol. The rice (they make sure the bowl is always full for you) and garlic naan were perfect additions.
The place itself is really cozy and seems like a fancier environment than most places in this price range. All around such a good first experience.
Will definitely be back!
