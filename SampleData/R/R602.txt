BYOB Indian restaurant tucked in a shopping plaza. Service and food are both ok. There were some unappetizing factors when about to eat a meal. More than one waiter smelled of body odor and another waiter walked around with a rag and spray bottle for tables. We had a wobbly table which I needed to request assistance with.
For the food, the naan was inconsistent. The first batch came out soft and moist.  The second batch was much better more crispy and dryer. As for the entrees, we had chicken tiki masala, which was tough as it had not really cooked in the sauce and needed to soften and cook in the sauce more. We also have a spinach dish which was very good. Food came out really fast, like it might have been sitting in a steam table. We weren't offered dessert. I think there are better options for Indian in the area.
