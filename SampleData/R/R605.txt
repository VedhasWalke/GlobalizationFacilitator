I am incredibly picky when it comes to eating Indian food in restaurants being that I was spoiled my whole life with home-cooked Indian food by my mom and other family members/family friends. Not many Indian restaurants grab my attention. They usually are very heavy, use a lot of oil, don't taste very good at all, make me feel gross after, etc. Cross Culture is one of the 4 Indian restaurants in the United States (so far that I've encountered in my 23 years of life) that I don't mind going to. The food is always great, and the service is as well. I'll always choose home cooked when it comes to Indian no matter what restaurant, but at least Cross Culture comes close. So if your standards are not as high as mine, and since I've been happy with their food -- I guarantee you will be as well.
