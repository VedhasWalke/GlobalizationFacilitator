This is always my favorite place to come whenever I am feeling Indian food. I have came here for lunch and dinner and I think the best time to come is during lunch time. For every curry dish (entree), you get rice, naan, and some sort of fried vegetables. This is a very good deal considering the amount of food you get. The rice is also unlimited which is great because the curry and the rice tastes amazing. The naan is also very good especially the garlic naan. Every single time I go, I always leave with a full stomach and feel very satisfied. This is the only Indian food I have ever had, so I am not sure if I am qualified to judge this as one of the best Indian foods I have ever had because this is the only Indian food that I have ever had. Stop by whenever you have a chance!!
