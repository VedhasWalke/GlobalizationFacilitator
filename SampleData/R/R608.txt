American-ized Indian is how I view Cross Culture.  I'm not sure I'm on board with all the heady reviews, although I enjoyed my dinner.
The menu is a little unique, and their eggplant dish is standout fantastic.  They specialize in Northern Indian cuisine, and do a great preparation of tandoori chicken, lamb, or even veggies, IIRC.  A lot of the classic Indian dishes are missing, but they make up for it with a few tweaks to standard items here and there.  As a heads up, there's not as much love for the vegan/vegetarian Indian connoisseur, but you can certainly get by.
The strip-mall location is par for the course in NJ, yet this is a high-end strip mall and Cross Culture is one of the nicer Indian restaurants I've visited.  Tables, bathrooms, plates, etc. were very clean.  It's a nice touch that they offer sparkling water service.  They even lit a candle on the table, which was cute.
The waiters are a little bit of a mixed bag.  My guy was great, but I overheard the waiter for the table next to me and it was comical, "you ready to order?"  "yeah, yeah, we'll do that."  "Is that it?"  etc.
Roti was good.  Chana Masala was a little funky for me.  The spices were not that robust while eating but seemed to linger in not necessarily a good way.
The Caucasian to Indian ratio was about 8:1, which was not especially impressive.  ;)
