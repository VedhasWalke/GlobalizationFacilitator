I am what you might call a regular to Cross Cultures. It is worlds apart from other 4-star rated Indian restaurants in the general vicinity. It is a touch more expensive but worth every penny.
Vegetarian dishes are heavenly. They are complex, satisfying, and flavorful. For a great treat try the tandoori paneer. Onion kulcha is classic.
