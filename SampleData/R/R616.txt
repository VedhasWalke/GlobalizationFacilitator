Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah!!!  OK so you do have the option of getting take out (obviously...) but dining in at Cross Culture, especially for lunch, is definitely the way to go.  Why, you ask?  Oh, allow me to shine some light on this little gem.  
It's a BYOB.  We are all aware of how that concept is my favorite concept, yes?  
After you order they give you little fried shredded squash...things and suuuuuper super delicious dipping sauces -- one spicy herb and one fruit.  It's like an amuse bouche!  You don't get those complimentary fritters with take out.  
The menu is well organized and extraordinarily well explained for an Indian restaurant in this part of the state.  I never had to ask my server to explain anything, even though they totally could have explained anything.
It's the best Indian restaurant in this part of the state.  And....therefore in the state I guess.  Wow.  That was a bold statement right there.  But I don't go anywhere else anymore.  I'm a Cross Culture girl now.  
The okra tomato dish is FANTASTIC.
They give you a scale when you ask for spice from 1-10.  Tread carefully, my darlings.  They mean business when you're like...."sssseeeevennn???"  And they smile inside because they know their seven is definitely NOT your seven.  Also I think 1-10 scales are stupid because they're so incredibly subjective and have no way to establish a baseline.
The price is right.  I'm thinking about one time when I went with two friends and we ordered three dishes total to share, didn't finish any of them, were all super full and satisfied, and each paid like 15 bucks with tip.  We could have ordered two and paid 10 bucks probably and wouldn't have had leftovers.  
Just go.  Trust me, it's solid.
