Amazing service and food. Definitely one of my favorite go to Indian restaurants in Princeton. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Masala, and Alu Gobi. The dishes were amazing and the quantity was perfect, it even left me feeling a bit too full. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for an amazing and authentic Indian restaurant to eat at while in Princeton.
