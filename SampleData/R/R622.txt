My large indian family really likes this place! Everything they have is really good, you can't go wrong. BUTT they're spicy scale (they'll ask you for a number between 1 and 10) really makes no sense, so I'd suggest sticking to a low number like 3/4 unless you can really handle your spice. My parents usually get 7 and even that is a little too spicy for them.
The deserts and tea here are also really good, and decor is cozy and intimate. All things considered a great dining experience!
