Cross Culture certainly ranks among the friendliest, most comfortable Indian restaurants in the Princeton area. I had lunch there with a friend the other day. Service was prompt & professional, and almost all aspects of the meal were delicious.
We started with pakora's which were not greasy, and the vegetable flavors really came through. The accompanying sauces were perhaps even better! My friend and I also had two chicken entrees -- curried chicken and chicken tikka masala. The former was tender, delicious, and spiced as requested. Yum. The tikka masala was just okay -- the only weak spot in the meal. The chicken tasted a bit rubbery, and was not as flavorful as the chicken in the curry. I often use the tikka masala dish as my benchmark when I try a new Indian place, because it is such a popular dish, and I have found that there can be a BIG difference between average & great in the execution. This was average.
We also ordered korma, which was top notch, and served with fragrant rice (happily refilled upon request). The Pappadums were also excellent, again with some of the pungent sauces as accompaniment.
You'll need to order off the menu, as CC does not do a lunch buffet (at least not on the day we went). But the menu has a wide variety of affordable choices. While the service here is prompt, I would not say this is the best choice if you want a quick lunch. In that event, order takeout & enjoy your meal on the very attractive green, nearby.
Cross Culture is BYOB, so bring wine if you like that with dinner. The interior decor here is comfortable & attractive enough for a dinner date, but still perfectly fine as a casual lunch spot. I am delighted that more & more good quality Indian food is cropping up in the central Jersey area, and this is definitely a good spot to try.
