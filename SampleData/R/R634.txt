Amazing! I came here today for lunch. Decor is simple and inviting inside and service is on point. The lunch special came with pakora which was crunchy on the outside and soft&spicy on the inside without being soaked in oil. The sauces that came with it were also exceptionally tasty.
My cousin and I shared the Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Makhani. This was by far the best vindaloo I've ever tasted. Not being Indian myself but having eaten lots of Indian foods in my life, I had to stop myself from stealing the whole dish to myself. I asked for it to be very spicy and the spice perfectly complemented the flavors of the dish. The Chicken Makhani was also well seasoned and I liked that they used strips of chicken breast in it. The lunch special also came with a lentil-type side that was good enough but unremarkable.
Would definitely come back to try their other dishes!
