My friends love Cross Culture so I was finally excited to get to the chance to join them one day for lunch.
Lunch is a steal here at Cross Culture. Most dishes range from $10-$14 and the portions are pretty reasonable. For starters were were given the pakora which was fried but not too greasy. Both the sauces were delicious and I used a combo of the two on my pakora. I ordered the Chicken Makhani which came with naan and rice. The sauce for the Chicken Makhani was perfect. My mouth is actually watering thinking about it!! Along with our lunch meals came a lentil dish which was also really good.
I ended up paying $15 for my meal (including tip) and even had enough leftovers for dinner. Many Indian restaurants in the area offer a lunch buffet around the same price so if you are looking to stuff yourself for a reasonable price go to the buffet. If you are looking for a nice, inexpensive meal then Cross Culture is for you.
