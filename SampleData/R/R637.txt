Yum! Fantastic indian cuisine!
My girlfriend and I are pretty big fans of indian food. She can handle some more of the spicy elements, while I am... well... a baby. Thankfully they cater to you and make everything to order.
I had a delicious paneer masala dish and they did me the favor of not adding much spice to it (upon request). For once I was able to eat it and not constantly sweat or gulp down my glass of water. At a buffet you usually have no choice, thankfully that's not the case here.
The service was responsive, the prices were on par with a restaurant of it's type, and the food was delicious. Even the rice was perfect!
I have eaten here twice in the past and I look forward to returning soon. :)
