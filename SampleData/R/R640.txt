One of the best Indian Restaurants in NJ.  Everything from their different types of leavened and unleavened bread, to their appetizers and of course their entrees accompanied by their rich and spicy sauces to their wonderful jasmine rice.  I cannot get enough of their food.  I highly recommend this place, especially if you live in the Princeton area or just visiting.  This is one of my FAVORITE Princeton restaurants that I frequent.
