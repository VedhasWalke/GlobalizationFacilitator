Tried paneer tikka, hara bhara kabab for starters; chicken tikka masala, malai kofta & dal makhani in the main course. Starters were delicious & overall food quality is great.Even the breads were very good..we had butter nan and onion kulcha.Just one note if you are a vegetarian your choices are limited!
