This place has decent food. To those who know their Indian food, this place dishes up little over mediocre but still better fate than most so called Indian restaurants across the country. I love their Malai Kofta and just ordered a portion less than a minute ago. The only thing that drags this place into the depths of culinary hell is not food by the way. It is the astonishing arrogance of their staff. I just spoke to this gentleman called 'Benson' when I called in to order. Here's how it went -
Me: "I'd like to order some food, I can come in around 10 minutes and pick it up"
Benson: "We at every busy right now and in any case our food is never ready in 10 mins, minimum 25 mins"
Me: "I'm ok with 25 mins, I'd like to order a portion of Malai Kofta, spice level 7 and 2 Nans"
...exactly 5 seconds later..
Me: "Wait, please cancel the Nans, I want just the Malai Kofta"
Benson (imagine rude voice with an Indian accent): "Sir make up your mind, we are very busy here, you first order and then you cancel, what exactly do you want"
Me: "why are you giving me attitude, can you not be polite? I changed my mind and I don't want the Nans, are you telling me I cannot cancel?"
Benson: "the order already went to the kitchen"
Really???!!!! You expect me to believe this shit?
Me: "you can't be serious! First of all you need to be polite to your customers"
Benson: "It's just my voice, I can't help it"
What a hole!
I'm going to go pick up my Malai Kofta in a bit. Please pray along with me that this dude Benson doesn't spit in it for my dining pleasure tonight.
Cross effing culture alright.
