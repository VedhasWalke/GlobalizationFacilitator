My favorite Indian place in town. Great catering too!
There are several Indian restaurants in town and Cross Culture is the best. Their lunch special is a great deal and lets you try the delicious pakora along with lentils and an entree of your choice.
The restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean. The staff are all very friendly and will help you find dishes to accommodate your preferences for spice.
