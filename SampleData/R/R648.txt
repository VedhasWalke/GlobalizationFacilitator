Yummmm I am eating the leftovers now and reminiscing about the great meal I enjoyed at Cross Culture last night. First, Cross culture is sort of a hidden gem off the beaten path of Nassau St in Princeton.  It is VERY popular and when we arrived the place was packed.  We were seated right away and asked for our drink orders.  I had the Mango Lassi which was tasty but I would not order it again as it costs $5.50.  For dinner, we ordered the chicken tandoori and the chicken makhani with panir kulcha (naan with sesame seeds and cheese).  The tandoori chicken was spiced just right and the onions and peppers were a nice compliment.  The chicken makhani was my favorite with a creamy tomato sauce and aromatic basmati rice.  FYI the soda costs $2.25 and its just a can so no refills.
