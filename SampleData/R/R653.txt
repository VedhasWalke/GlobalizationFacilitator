The food was very delicious and being an Indian I can guarantee that the taste was authentic. The naan was soft and we really loved it. I had chicken tikka while my friend took lamb biryani, and we both enjoyed our meals. The only problem was that service was bit slow, we had to wait for 10 mins for waiter to show up to take orders and 15 mins post dinner for him to give us the bill. 4 stars.
