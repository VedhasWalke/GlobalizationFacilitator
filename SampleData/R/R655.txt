Top notch Indian restaurant with friendly service, good prices, and fresh quality dishes.  
For lunch, the dishes came with rice, naan, and an unexpected fried vegetable/chickpea pieces that were magnificent  - not too greasy with a fresh vegetable flavor.  Served with mint and tamarind dipping sauce, these were devoured quickly.  
The chicken vindaloo was light and sufficiently spicy, a unique take on a classic dish.  The lamb korma was very creamy, also a hit.  I can hardly wait to go back.
