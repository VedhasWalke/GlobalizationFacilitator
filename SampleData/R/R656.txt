I've eaten at this restaurant more than fifty (50) times over the past 4-5 years and I keep returning because the food is outstanding and the service is quite good. My wife and I are vegetarians and frequent Indian restaurants because their cuisine fits our dietary habits. The menu selection offers a large number of non-meat options and the appetizers are always fresh and well done. Most of the time we take food home because we can't finish the meals.
Service is always prompt and they have been willing to change dishes if asked (i.e. to make a dish without dairy - if the recipe permits). Spice levels can also be moderated. Meals cost between $35 and $45 for the two of us not including tip.
I highly recommend this Indian restaurant.
