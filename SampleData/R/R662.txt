I have eaten here several times and found the food to be of high quality with a friendly staff and clean and lovely ambiance. Cross Culture is not fancy but locals consistently comment on the outstanding curries, naan, and other fare that are all served with attention--excellent, complex spicing of the dishes with quality ingredients. We will keep coming back here!
