Food is excellent-- great quality ingredients, cooked well, etc.  
They have a lunch special which is convenient.  However, it is more practical to offer 2 small entree items, one veg/one nonveg or 2 veg per lunch special, but you can only choose one entree item.  That's OK though, because we ordered off the dinner menu.  
Overall, the food easily reaches a standard of excellence for Indian cuisine.  The restaurant is also very nice and clean inside, and they offer outdoor seating for the summertime.
