Decor was good and food was pleasant however why is it three stars you ask???
Ordered the tika and other regular favorites including the samosas that the common crowd orders...common defined as not being native Indian.
The portions were decent and price is around typical dinner menu price however I noticed the rice they served was totally not fresh.
You can tell if the rice was frozen or in the fridge the night before then heated up when find it difficult to separate the small blocks in the rice bowl it is served in.  You know the rice cubes you get when you try to reheat old Chinese food from the fridge.
Note to the manager of this place...Plz cook fresh rice everyday bc I heard fresh is 'in'.
