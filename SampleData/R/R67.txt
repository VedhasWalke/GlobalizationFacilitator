As I told them while I was there this past Friday, this place is, "SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!"
The food was absolutely fantastic! Even better, the service was phenomenal! If you're looking for great Indian food in a really nice atmosphere this is your place. My friend and I did the 2 person special they had that day. If they have it while you're there I'd highly recommend it. It came with a ton of food! If you're new to Indian cuisine and not sure what to get I'd suggest starting with Korma. It's very mild on spice, but still extremely tasty! If you like spice make sure to order at least Medium Plus as your spice level. I really can't wait to go again! See you again soon, Crown of India!
