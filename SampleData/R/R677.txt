Service was very friendly and efficient.  Over a year ago we had dinner at their sister location in Doylestown, Pa - big disappointment.  However, the Princeton site is very good.  Lamb vindaloo, breads and chicken tandoori were all very good.  Nothing to complain about!  Men's room was clean.  BYOB
Definitely worth another visit.
