This is the best Indian food in town. I always order the vegetarian samosas, naan, raita, and one or two vegetarian entrees and everything I've had has been great. My only problem with the food is that it isn't very spicy and I always forget to ask them to make it spicy. I normally just ask for hot sauce and/or cayenne pepper on the side. I also love that they are open until 10 so I can still satisfy my Indian food craving late night. Delicious! I highly recommend!
FYI: BYOB.
