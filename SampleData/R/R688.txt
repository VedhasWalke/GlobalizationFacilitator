Stopped by for take out on a Friday early (5:15) as it was on the way home & they had a good on-line ordering system. But the food disappointed by its small serving size and lack of chutneys & pickle, which are standard at so many other places. The food was fine, though the lack of any discernible vegetables was striking. They overloaded us with rice. In the end, was expensive for what we received. Probably won't stop there again given all the better options in the area.
