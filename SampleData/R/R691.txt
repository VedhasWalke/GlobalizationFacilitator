Excellent food with a nice presentation. We had a lovely meal with attentive service. The variety of dishes is standard Indian fare in the classic American traditional Indian mode. All the favorites (samosas, pappadams, spinach balls, korma, naan, tikka) were prepared with a light touch. The tandori dishes were juicy without the often dried out character that baking in a tandoor can engender.
Definitely worth a visit.
