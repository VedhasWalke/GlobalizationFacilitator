Got here at lunch. They had one guy taking orders for 20+ tables.  We were served water 20 minutues after arrival. he then took our  order. Got complimentary  snacks another 20 minutes later. Overall the food is good, but the service is consistently bad. Sorry, this was my third time experiencing this here. Get it together.
