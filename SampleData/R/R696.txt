Very good restaurant with fantastic service. Favorites include dal makhani, baingan bartha (eggplant), and either chicken tikka masala or paneer (cheese) tikka masala. My son who has a limited palate always wants chicken fingers when we go and theirs are really excellent and served with fries (go figure).
