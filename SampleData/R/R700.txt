My review is strictly based on the food as I placed a catering order with Cross Culture.
When a restaurant can execute a catering order for a large amount of people you know you have come to a great restaurant. This holds for Cross Culture. The food is consistent, they use high quality ingredients, and they are very professional.
When I walked in on Christmas I was greeted by Naveen who was very professional.
I ordered tray of:
Kebabs, Tandoori chicken, and a few other types. All were delicious but I loved the Kebabs. The chicken was juicy and not dry.
Chicken Tikka Masala- it was flavorful and had good heat for our family.
Chana Masala- it was spicy, chunky, and the garbanzo beans were not mushy.
Naan bread- was freshly made on the day of and was great even after we warmed it in the oven.
