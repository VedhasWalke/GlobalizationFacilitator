Predictable and well done Indian food is a rarity in NJ, but CC somehow manages to get it right. Have ordered the range of veggie, seafood, and meat dishes and they are flavorful 8 out of 10 times. Service is what you expect from a suburban Indian restaurant - nothing outstanding. Watch out for those deceptive spice levels - a medium was an actual medium by Indian standards and a hot will have you sweating.
