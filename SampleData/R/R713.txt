My boyfriend and I were out on a very cold Sunday afternoon and I thought I would try this place since I hadn't had Indian food for a while (due the inconsistency of the Indian restaurants in the area).  
When we sat down I was tempted to order some soup but their soups are pretty expensive so I decided to pass on that.
I ordered the vegetable biryani.   It was very tasty and had some nice lima beans and cashews as well as some other vegetables.  It seemed a little heavy on the oil though.   It came with raita which was very good as well.  
My boyfriend ordered Indian masala tea and cashmere chicken , it came with white rice.  It would have been nice if the rice was delicately spiced  but it was ok.   The chicken and sauce were tasty and not very spicy.  We also enjoyed tandoori roti without butter.  
I think it was kind of expensive though , the bill came to $40.   I think they should lower the soup prices.    As another reviewer mentioned it would be nice if they offered some southern dishes but perhaps that isn't their specialty.
I might return again if I am in an extravagant mood or maybe to get some takeout as a treat.  
This could have been a great meal but it missed the mark.  
I gave it  three stars for good tasting food.  I would have liked to rate it higher but  service was professional but just a tad cold.  I took off stars for the high price, loud music and they didn't offer any chutneys (you shouldn't have to ask).   Also we had a little difficulty getting the check but maybe they just didn't want to rush us.
