Excellent quality and ambiance.
Indian food in Princeton varies a lot and it's difficult to find a consistent experience, even at one restaurant. I hesitate to give a huge, glowing review based on one visit, but if the second visit is anything like the first, I'll go to 5 stars.
I had the Cashmere Chicken and my bf had the Chicken Vindaloo and it was all extremely tasty.
Pleasant, attentive staff. Loved it!
