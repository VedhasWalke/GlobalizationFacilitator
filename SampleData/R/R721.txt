I have eaten Indian food all over the world, and this restaurant is as about as good as it gets. Absolutely wonderful food. Definitely the best in the Princeton area. The staff is friendly, but not imposing. The price is just right.
The menu is kind of limited, in the sense that it doesn't run into pages, so you need to stick to standard stuff. The paneer dishes are amazing. Try paneer masala. It would be nice to have starters other than pakoras on the lunch menu especially for people who don't like deep fried stuff.
