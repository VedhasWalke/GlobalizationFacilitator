We were here for lunch on a Saturday and although they don't have a buffet as such, they provide the opportunity to order an entree and provide you with sufficient naan (bread), daal (pulses and beans), rice and reasonable amount of pakoras (appetizer - mixed vegetables in chick pea flour and fried).  Food was excellent and prices were extremely reasonable.
