My wife and I went last night and we had a great time. The place is clean and simplistic. It's a BYOB and the service was excellent. We started with apps, including a huge bread basket and mix veggie appetizer. They were good, the veggie app was 3 fried items including samosas. It came with 2 sauces, sweet and tangy, and spicy mint. For dinner I had chicken tikka masala and asked them to make it a little spicy (4 out of 10), and it came out perfect. My wife had the navraton korma, which was a veggie coconut curry sweeter dish. Everyone around was getting the simmering Tandori dishes, such as the mixed grill, and they looked and smelled great. We will definitely go back to try those and the desserts, because we were too full to get one this time.
