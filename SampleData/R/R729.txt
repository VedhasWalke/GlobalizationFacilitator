Wow, how am I only the second person to review this place and I don't even live in Princeton?  Cross Culture is apparently a new addition to the Princeton Shopping Center, and I'm super excited about this discovery.  They make some of the best Indian food I've had in awhile.  I went with my family for a pre-Christmas dinner.  There were five of us, so we tried a bunch of different items.  From the appetizer menu: chicken samosas, harabhara kabab, and the panir tikka (OMG amazing!).  For entrees we had: chicken korma (one of my all-time favorites, excellently done), lamb curry, tandoori chicken, bhindi masala (awesome okra dish).  All of it was super yummy and I can't wait to go back!
