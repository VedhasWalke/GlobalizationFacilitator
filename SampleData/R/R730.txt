My wife and I have eaten here several times and I also regularly meet a friend for lunch at Cross Culture. The food is always excellent, service top notch, and the atmosphere quite pleasant. Let's start with lunch. Cross Culture does not have a buffet, but the lunch specials menu absolutely makes up for it. Choose basically any entree you want (even if it's not on the list) and it is served with unlimited rice, dal, and naan. Also included for an appetizer are pakoras which are excellent. Lunches average around $12 and for what you get it's a bargain. Dinner is excellent as well. We're not new to Indian cuisine and even if something is not on the menu the staff are more than willing to accommodate. I would classify the prices as more than fair for the portion size. The food is top notch, well seasoned, and extremely fresh. The biggest positive  about Cross Culture food is the consistency. Unlike many other Indian restaurants in the area, this one does not suffer from the constant change of chefs and kitchen staff. The food is always spot on and has been great from the first time we went. Been visiting regularly for about a year and a half and it's just great every time. The owner is a very nice guy and really gets involved and engages the customers. Overall, we love Cross Culture and highly recommend.
