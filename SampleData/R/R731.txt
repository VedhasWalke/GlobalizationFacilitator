Really liked this place. Went here for lunch on my lunch hour. Food was delicious and came out very fast. There is no lunch buffet. instead they offer an "executive lunch" which comes with rice, pakoras, daal and a main course. Very reasonable and all very good. Service was excellent. I would definitely go back.
