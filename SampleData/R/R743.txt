I have been eating Indian food since 1978 and this is one of the best! Having moved here from the mecca of Indian food, Edison, I was a bit sceptical that this would be an authentic experience.  Was I ever wrong!  This is delicious, fresh Indian cuisine, spiced just right.  We had chicken biryani; the meat was tender and aromatic.  Shrimp karahi was equally delicious, served in a spicy tomato sauce, perfect with basmati rice.  Most restaurants charge for raita but here it was included with our breat order, garlic naan.  Service was informative and prompt, yet we were not rushed.  I give this place a major thumbs up and recommend that  you try it.
