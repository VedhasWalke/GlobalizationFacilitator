I ordered takeout here after reading the positive reviews on Yelp, and was dismayed to discover how terrible the food was. I ordered the Chicken Curry and despite the $15 price, it was very low-quality meat (probably leg or thigh bits, which were badly cooked) in a sauce that was little more than grease. Very little flavor; it was grotesque and inedible grease. I felt sick after having two small bites and had to throw the whole thing away. The other person had a vegetable dish and reported strong disappointment that there was little in the way of vegetables, some cheese cubes, but primarily the container had been filled with sauce rather than solids. We spent close to forty dollars between those two dishes and the bread, and I consider the shamefully low quality of the food to have comprised a completely dishonest product. Certainly, no one could reasonably claim that the Chicken Curry was a real attempt to make decent food. It was absolutely disgusting!
