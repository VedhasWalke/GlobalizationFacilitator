The place offers a nice mix of classical and innovative regional Indian cuisine mostly from the south. BYOB. Loved the ambience and the wide selection of entrees. We ordered three things- Chili Paneer (C+), Masala Dosa (A+), and Veg Kothu Parotta (Chopped layered bread cooked with vegetables and onions) (B+). Paneer pieces were too hard - perhaps overdone or not fresh or both. Masala Dosa with both the chutney and sambhar were really well done. Parotta was good but, in retrospect, should have picked a more basic entree.
Lots more to sample so we are sure to return, this time on a non-busy day.
Metered parking on street and paid garage close by.  I don't believe they validate parking for the garage or if that is even possible.  
P.S: Heavily discounting the rating because we decided to try them out on Valentine's Day. It was a bit of chaos and while we had to wait for our food, it was not nearly as bad as some folks who waited for 90 mins.  Tip to the management: anticipate crowd on certain days and  (a) don't overbook, b) don't take delivery  orders, and (c) perhaps get extra help in kitchen.
