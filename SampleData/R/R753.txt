The service: The attention was undeniably elegant, friendly, and so much detail to attention. Leo especially recommended a few thing and the main waiter recommended the Kaalan pattani milagu..
The kaalan pattani milagu was aromatic, sensual as mushrooms always tend to be. My girl says it was similar to a Colombian guiso but with Indian ingredients. . . . I agree.
Can't wait to come back to try other deliciousness
Oh and the garlic naan.. we hate like 4 plate fuls
