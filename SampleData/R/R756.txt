Delicious Indian food hampered by mediocre service
Our family of four recently visited Chennai Chimney for a delicious and (comparatively) inexpensive dinner. I might have given five stars based on the dishes I ordered...but poor service prevented that.
The dishes I chose - the Rogan Josh and Jeenga Aatish (tandoor shrimp) - were indeed quite perfect. The shrimp was flavorful with bright notes of citrus and cardamom while the lamb was earthy and spicy with enough heat to grab your attention.
The Mysore Masala Dosa, Virudhunagar Chukkakari Dosa (lamb w/ onion masala), garlic naan, and cucumber raita were all quite good. The eggplant in the Ennai kathirikai was a bit mealy but the sauce - a spiceful though not spicy coconut sauce - was delicious.
I thought the deep fried chicken lollipops were best avoided but my son loved them. However, the Gobi 65 - deep fried batter hiding what was theoretically cauliflower inside - was rather awful.
Many have commented on having issues with the service and we had some as well - but oddly enough only with our ordered beverages. Our food arrived in good order and our water glasses were refilled attentively and as needed. But of our four beverages only the Masala Butter Milk arrived promptly. We asked about our Masala Chais and Rose Milk at least three times through our meal but to no avail - they all finally came at the end after we had finished.
