I was not very impressed by the food here or the cleanliness of the tables. The tablecloths were stained and the salt/pepper shakers had mystery crud on them. In terms of the food we got the veggie pakoda, which was bland and had a very strong breading flavor. Paired with the tomato curry, which was decent, they were an ok way to balance out the heat of the curry. I got the lamb biryani and I was quite disappointed. While it had a good spice kick, it was very oily and the lamb was chewy and not flavorful. Also, they left a lot of the intact spices in the rice, such as full cloves and cardamom pods.. little bombs.. not fun to bite down on. Overall, there's no reason to go here instead of cross culture.
