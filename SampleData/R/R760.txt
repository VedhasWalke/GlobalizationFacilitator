Had a lovely date-night meal with my wife here this past Saturday night.  Had 7 o'clock reservations, but easily could have walked in without them as the dining room was only about 2/3 full.  We started with the murg til tikka appetizer, which was quite a large portion for an appetizer.  It was nicely spiced and perfectly juicy, we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  For our entree we shared orders of chicken vindaloo and phaldari kofta.  The malai kofta was perfectly seasoned, spicy enough to get your attention but not so much as to distract from the flavor with a generous portion of chicken throughout.  The phaldari kofta was delicious, one of the better versions of this dish that I have had in quite a while. The double cream sauce with cashews and raisins certainly mitigated any health benefits on going for a vegetarian dish, but the calories were certainly worth it!  I do wish that there had been a few more paneer dumplings, but maybe there were just looking out for my well being by keeping the serving size where it was as there was absolutely no chance that I would have let a single morsel go to waste.  Add in an order of butter naan to enjoy and to sop up the sauce and we ended up with a filling and delicious meal for  under $70 including 20% tip.  The only negative was the service, which was extremely friendly, but a bit disorganized and quite slow.  The bottle of wine we brought with us helped to pass the time, and it certainly didn't ruin the experience, but it was noteworthy.  Still, a very good choice for an affordable and tasty meal right in the middle of Princeton, an activity that is becoming harder and harder to accomplish.
