One of the better restaurants in Princeton, NJ.  Chennai Chimney serves good Indian food at a higher price point.
Definitely order the biryani if you visit.  I've tried a few different variations, the Chicken Dum Biryani is very good and one of my favorite dishes.  The rice is sooo good and spiced well.  The chicken that accompanied the rice is extremely tender and can be picked apart with a fork.  Often times they will have special biryanis, you may need to ask after you sit down.  I have yet to try a biryani from Chennai Chimney that hasn't been really really good.
The Gobi Chicken (65) is tender pieces of fried chicken spiced well.  This is also a very good dish that I've had on a number of occasions.  
I've tried the dosa here and the dosa itself is fried well and crispy.  The chutneys that accompany the dish will vary, generally speaking I only use the coconut chutney and can say it's good.
I always order the Marsala Chai before or after dinner and I'd say most times this is always a good version.  On occasion it hasn't been good but most times it has.
One thing I've learned is that the portion sizes, which for some dishes may not be very generous, are better sitting in then take out.  Another fact to keep in mind, they are closed on Mondays.
