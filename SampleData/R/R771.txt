A unique South Indian surprise in the heart of Princeton. Been open for a year and we finally discovered it this time around. Simple yet clean elegant ambience , in a welcoming neighborhood. Well trained staff, ( especially Vijay) knowledgeable , offered clear  recommendations,  and the food was served in a timely manner , well plated , right temperature and perfectly spiced. All fish and meat dishes were cooked to perfection and pleasing to the eye, and extremely appetizing. Owned by a Chennai & Madurai duo, they have created an inviting Chettinad / Indian menu that is made using authentic ground spices and the end result being delectably crafted dishes largely from the southern part of India, that tingle your taste buds every step of your meal.
DO NOT MISS THIS SPOT !!
Here's a run down of the high and low points and what we relished.
