Food here is something everyone should experience here!! Authentic Indian taste and totally worth the buck! We ordered Chicken biryani, Kozhi 65, Ennai Kathirikai with butter Naan and the portions are more than regular. Loved all of them! Even the deserts (Double ka meetha and Gulab jamun) are delicious
