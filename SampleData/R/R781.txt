I feel this place has gone done in quality.  Something is lacking, the ingredients and the quality of food is just not there.  I went for lunch buffet a few times, each time I don't know what I ate other than some curry sauce with nann. In the past they would bring fresh nann and dosa, now they don't.  They don't refill the food, they want to refill until it's completely empty?  No one wants to take the last piece of nann that's being sitting there for who knows how long?  Comparing this place to Jhopori in Plainsboro, Jhopori is so much better!  Also this place smells and they try to cover it up with incense.  Again, for the same price go to Jhopori for lunch buffet, you will see and feel the difference!
