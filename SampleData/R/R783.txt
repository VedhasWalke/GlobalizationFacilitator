Stopped in to get takeout on my way home and ordered Vegetable Kurma, described as "seasonal mix vegetables cooked with coconut paste and spices" for $13.95 and some naan. I waited about 15 minutes for it and when I got home and opened it, it was 90% liquid with a few extremely overcooked carrots and potatoes in it. The sauce was very dense, as if it was just the bottom of a pot they threw in the take-out container. To their credit, when I called to complain, they sent a replacement order, which was somewhat better.
