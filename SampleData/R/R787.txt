The Indian food here was great, started out with lamb dosa which was my absolute favorite, the dosa was fresh and crispy and the lamb was well seasoned. Then had butter chicken and lamb biryani and both were good. The butter chicken tastes very good and cream. The biryani was a bit spicy and the rice was too sticky because of all the seasoning in it so I would say the biryani was the least of my favorite but all of them were really good nevertheless , definitely plan to wait if no reservation, the place was packed the whole time we were there. the food took quite a bit to come out but it was a full house so that's understandable. Great authentic Indian food.
