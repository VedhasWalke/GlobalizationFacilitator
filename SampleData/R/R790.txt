Went for lunch buffet today, and was very disappointed. The quality of food, service and ambiance has gone down.  There was one waiter only and he was extremely rude.
They have changed the placement of buffet, and taken away prime window area...looks like a school cafeteria now!
They used to bring fresh naan and dosa to the table, not anymore.
Saw kitchen staff get food from the same buffet, while guests were eating.
Have been going here for few years now, but after our experience today, we are done. There are many options to choose from and this is not one that I would recommend anymore.
