We went to celebrate my birthday yesterday at Chennai Chimney and upon our arrival, we were told that they were not accepting any reservations. I explained to him that we already had reservations that we made on Open Table. He clumsily responded that he meant that they were booked with a private reservation and therefore would not be honoring any reservations made online. I was appalled! The manager did not offer any apologies or considerations for the inconvenience that they had caused me and my party. I left the restaurant and looked on Open Table to find another restaurant and notice that Chennai Chimney was still taking reservations. This is a terrible restaurant and I hope they go out of business.
By the way, we ended up at Mehek in Princeton and the food was delicious, the service was hospitable and their recommendations were perfect!
