I give Chennai Chimney a solid four. My opinions on Indian food may not be worth much but I got North Indian cuisine since I'm more familiar with it and I wasnt disappointed. Good spice and not too creamy. Definitely would like to try South Indian food with someone who can steer me in the right direction. Oh and it is BYOB. I think I saw a misleading review saying it's not or rather "this place would be better if it was BYOB." I called and it is BYOB so I was able to enjoy some nice beers with my friend and my meal. :)
