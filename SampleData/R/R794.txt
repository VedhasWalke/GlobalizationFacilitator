Usually I go into detail about 5 things that make or break a restaurant but the experience at Chennai Chimney was very unique.
On a double date, we entered the restaurant and after sitting down, a situation occurred. A waiter immediately started to seize - shaking uncontrollably, frothing in the mouth, and losing all sense of mobility. Thankfully, I called 911 and my friend, being in EMT instructed the staff on how to help him.
Once everything was settled down, we got up to go find another restaurant but was stopped by the manager who insisted that we should stay. While the food looked good, we were a little worried about sanitation due to the situation. Still we stayed.
After the food arrived, we realized that they had given us an extra dish which we did not order. We talked to the waiter who insisted that we ordered it but after checking his notepad, he realized he messed up. Overall the food was pretty good (4/5) - definitely one of the better Indian places we've had. We got the chicken Tiki masala, dosa, Bollywood special, and some Rice & Naan.
Once the meal was over, the waiter gave us the check and started to guess our races - lol. While we were fine with it, it was a little strange. After we paid, as he was cleaning up, he dropped a water glass from a couple inches. Somehow this water glass exploded into a thousand pieces. The waiter didn't apologize and just simply told us to move so he could clean it up. No one was hurt but it would've been nice to receive an apology or some form of compensation.
All said and done, a very strange night. At least the food was decent!
