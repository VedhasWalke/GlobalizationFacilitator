This is a real gem find in Princeton so much so that we are willing to travel 1 hour just for this place. We started with vada sambhar, kodi dosa, idli vada sambhar. Food is served in copper plates and banana leaves. And the taste is amazing. For main course we ordered shrimp curry, chicken ghee roast which was outstanding and kadai sabzi with a bread basket of onion kulcha, garlic naan and roti ( u can pick your mix) with Unlimited rice. Authentic South Indian food experience with very reasonable prices. Must visit place.
