We stressed them on what was probably the single busiest week of the year for them---reunions and graduation at Princeton. And for all that, having had at least the foresight to make an Open Table reservation, they got a party of 8 seated, helped us select very tasty food (the spiciness of some of the dishes was complemented by those in our party who really like their food with some zing!), had it all out quickly, and helped one of our party get something that was slightly off menu.  I would say---we might have had the very best server in the restaurant (sorry, it had been a long day and we were a bit overwhelmed, so I can't remember his name)---but with this one server, we found our service rapid, polite, informed, and courteous.  The entire party remarked on it.
I can see how others might have a different experience, but this was ours and I would go back.  Thank you Chennai!
