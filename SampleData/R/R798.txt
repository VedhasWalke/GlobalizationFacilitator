The server was unbelievably rude. We were three people and he wouldn't let us pay separately - not with separate bills and not even split the same bill over three credit cards. You can't force people to pay for each other's dinner!
And if that wasn't enough, two minutes after we paid the bill the same server literally kicked us out of the restaurant to make room for the next patrons. He wasn't even asking, he literally showed us out. This was by far the worst service that I've ever encountered in the US.
