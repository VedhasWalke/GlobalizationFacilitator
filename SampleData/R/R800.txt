This place is so great!!! The food is out of this world amazing.  First, it's adorable and located on Chambers Street. Second, more importantly, it's a BYOB. Score!
A couple disappointing things first off, we had 7:30 reservations, and we got there things seemed very chaotic. We were seated practically on top of 2 other tables (could elbow them we were so close) and the room was VERY hot. The servers were very apologetic about having run out of menus, asked us to share when we first got started. Eventually the room did cool down, but it was still relatively warm. Normally these would completely detract from my star-rating, but the food was so delicious- it's still 5 stars!
We went with another couple, so there were 4 of us; hungry, excited, and ready to explore the menu.
The food was amazing. Seriously amazing. We sampled a variety of dishes throughout the menu, didn't get any of the specials, but we'll try that next time.  
You're served on a gold platter with a banana leaf, the leaf is your "plate" essentially, a really cute touch.
At the end of the night, the owner came over to talk with us (and ask if we were on Yelp!!) which was just a perfect way to end the evening. He was so nice, and explained how the 2 desserts we ordered, we made - very cool to hear about!
Street Samosa & Paneer Tikka Multani (both were so fantastic! The samosas are actually vegan)
Phaldari Paneer Kofta (interesting & delicious!)
Old Delhi Butter Chicken (yes- great!!)
Nilgiri Lamb Kurma (great!)
Peshwari Boti Kebab (so good!!)
Kashmiri Naan (unbelievable!)
Sriviffipithur Plakova & Ashoka Halwa (the desserts, sweet, interesting, and definitely worth a try, personally not my particular taste- very sweet.)
Overall- GO!! Go check this out, maybe dress in layers. Some new-restaurant kinks to work out still, but hopefully this one stays around for a while, I can't wait to go back!
