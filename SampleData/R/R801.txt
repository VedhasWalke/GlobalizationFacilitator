It's a very chic place in Princeton downtown. Very cool vibes and the crowd when we went was mostly local office going folks. We went for the lunch buffet on a weekday.
The spread was ok. Just one appetizer while other local Indian restaurants offer far more. But the onion pakoda was a 10 on 10. So was the rasam.
I don't like a mixed buffet with not many choices for vegetarians. But chennai chimney wasn't so. I cannot talk about the meat items but the vegetarian ones were very nice.
I took away stars for a few reasons: 1. I would have liked the tables to be farther apart. It's like sharing the table with 12 other people 2. I expected South Indian items on the buffet spread but it was a disappointment to not find any. 3. The dessert was terrible.
But note that this review is ONLY for the buffet. Maybe dinner time would be better! I will go again during dinner time and update the rating - maybe!
