The only reason I rate this restaurant a 2 is because  I reserve one star for restaurants that make me sick. To start with, their chai masala is incredible small, akin to an espresso shot. When our waiter set it down, my husband said "is this a sample" and the waiter just walked away and didn't return until with our dinner. As a metric, I had my "baseline" of chicken (murg) tikka masala - for which the chicken was rubbery although the gravy had a nice spice. My husband had the peas and mushrooms curry kaalan pagani magalu... although marked in the menu as spicy it was bland, and the primary "flavor" was the high amount of oil. We will not be back.... although we've been here before, they've never impressed.
