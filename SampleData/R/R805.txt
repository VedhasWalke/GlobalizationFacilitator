Intimate but swanky Indian restaurant in the heart of Princeton. Great decor and friendly service. Before our food, these crunchy finger foods were brought out with what seemed like diced tomatoes. Fascinating.
We started with the street samosas which were tasty, but small for the price. The sauces with them were amazing though. For mains, we ordered the Nadan Fish Curry in its hot spicy iteration. It was a unique and delectable in taste, with huge chunks of fish. Definitely a winner. We also had the Prawn mango coconut dish medium spicy, which was sweet and a good spicy at the same time. This was a definite favorite. Tender shrimp, not prawns, but still freakin delicious. Dark orange sauce for both, but each different in flavor. The cheese naan was a nice addition to eat with the mains - paired perfectly.
When we got our food, a man who we presumed to be the owner or manager walked up and told us that we were supposed to put the food down on the leaf first, and then eat it, as it anti-oxidized the food and would take on a little of the leaf flavor. It was a great way to dine.
Would definitely go back here and try their other dishes. Fabulous little dining delight.
