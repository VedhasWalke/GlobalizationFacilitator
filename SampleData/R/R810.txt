Chennai Chimney was awesome!!! Really fresh food!!! tasty spices and fresh Vegetables and meats!!! We had the Bombay sizzler and Goan fish Curry which was awesome. I've never had Goan cuisine, and loved the blending of Portuguese and Indian flavors as they come together beautifully in this dish. The Chai was great too!! and the staff were really friendly. The owner also came out and asked how the meal was, he's very friendly and absolutely invested in making sure that the food meets your expectations.
The restaurant was also packed and everyone was clearly happy with their food.
they're definitely doing everything right in Princeton where their are many resto's competing for your appetite.
