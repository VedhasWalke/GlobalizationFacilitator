As someone who comes from a family that takes South Indian food VERY seriously (almost religiously), and will straight up eat out at the same restaurant every week for months on end, because we are obsessed with specialties like dosas and rasam, chennai chimney sadly disappointed.
This place replaced masala grill and is inarguably catered for the American palette. It doesn't use authentic South Indian flavors/spices in its foods and you can tell when you taste the foods that it's completely white-washed. I guess our caveat was that we went on a Sunday, so we had a buffet, but that is still no excuse for the poor quality and lack of authenticity. The soups were lukewarm, starchy, and unappetizing. The desserts didn't seem fresh, and the drinks appeared watered down. Also, South Indian food is vegetarian friendly to the point where the sheer number of options can be overwhelming. Here, most dishes were non-veg or cooked with non-veg ingredients. As a result, we had to eat pakoras, rice and a salad as our meal. This was not only dissatisfying, but a very poor reflection on the restaurant's variety and character.
BIGGEST red flag: they didn't even have dosas!!!!! Every other South Indian restaurant in the area has dosa's regardless of the day, and go to extreme lengths to brag about why theirs' is better than the competition. I mean, what's the point of going to eat South Indian food and not having a dosa (or idli for that matter)??
I appreciated their really kind service/interior deco, but I also appreciated the fact I didn't get any food poisoning.
