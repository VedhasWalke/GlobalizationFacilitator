Finally! A South Indian restaurant in Princeton proper! That's enough to give you some stars. Now the seating can be a bit cramped if you end up in one of the side tables-- so on a Saturday night it may be worth calling in advance to snag a middle table.
It doesn't have all the south Indian fixes, but if has enough (and some unique ones you hardly find in restaurants and normally find at home) to check out.
I'm vegetarian-- the manchurian appetizer was AWESOME! I also had the kotthu-- it was good but not the best I've had. Someone in my party ordered the appams-- they were a little over cooked which was disappointing. The meat eaters in my group looked their food.
Also-- the north Indian food here is good, but as a rule, when you go to a South Indian restaurant...get the south Indian food. Try something different than chicken tikka.
Is this the best Indian food in central NJ? Of course not. But given the lack of quality Indian food on Nassau, I'm glad we have chennai chimney in town.
