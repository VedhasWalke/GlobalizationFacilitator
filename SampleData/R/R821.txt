If you haven't tried South Indian food, this regional specialty restaurant delivers a unique menu! Try the Tamatar Shimla Mirch Shorba, a complex spicy tomato soup, and Ennai kathirikai, a bowl of Asian eggplant in roasted vegetables. For a Chennai specialty, try the Madurai Idly, which comes with three rice pancakes to dip in various vegetarian sauces.
A great stop for vegetarians! Friendly service, lovely atmosphere, and good value for the money. One of the best restaurants in Princeton.
