SMALL portions we were told we ordered from the appetizer menu when it was plain and Cleary LISTED on main entree section, they LIED to us basically. They did not serve the food all together. My wife had to wait fifteen extra minutes to eat!
We had to tell the lady serving us 4 times to please take away the tap water from our table. Ordered bottle water! She did not seem to understand or care.....
Never again!
