Came here with a party of four, without reservations and got seated almost immediately, after being told that we had to be done by 7:30 because they needed or table for other guests. We got water and menus right away, and didn't have a server come until 6:50, about twenty minutes later.  Half an hour later a plate of cauliflower came out, just as another couple sat down next to us. That couple was served almost immediately after they ordered, and by the time we got our food, it was 7:30, an HOUR after we arrived. We also ordered bread, which should NOT have taken an hour to make and should have came out right away. The couple sitting. next to us had left by the time we had gotten our food, which was ridiculous. I would never consider coming back here especially because the quality of the food was horrible and the service was even worse!  Don't come here it's a huge mistake!!
