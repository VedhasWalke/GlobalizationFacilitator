Decided to try this place rather than going to the restaurants I normally frequent in Princeton, and I'm so so glad I came here.
The fried okra was delicious and tasted even better after I squeezed some lemon juice onto them. The tikka masala I had was phenomenal, and it paired well with the basmati rice and the garlic and butter naan I got on the side. I will gladly return again in the near future!
