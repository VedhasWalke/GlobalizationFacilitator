I have only had the Sunday buffet here, so I am not able to comment on their regular menu.
The pros -
Elegant decor.
Attentive service.
Large buffet selection.
The cons-
The main food entrees (chicken, lamb, etc. all had bones in them - I hate that)
The flavors were just okay - nothing outstanding.
The price for a Sunday buffet was about $17 per head - way too high for just average tasting Indian food.
I wanted to like this place more, as the service and hosts were very gracious, but I won't be back.
