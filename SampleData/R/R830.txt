I keep coming back here.  The staff is really polite and serves with a smile. Sunil is very nice and made sure we enjoyed the food.
Must try :  crispy okra
Also try appam and the tomato soup .  Very authentic taste.
Every time you go, the taste is exactly the same. My mood upflifts whenever I eat here !
