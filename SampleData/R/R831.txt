We were visiting Princeton with our high schooler as He is looking at Princeton University as a prospective school. We stumbled upon this Indian  restaurant online and decided to give it a try. We were planning on ordering but decided to give the buffet a go. Chicken was extremely fatty, sambar was anything but authentic, lack on vegetarian options, no food except for the rice or gulab jaman was truly any good. We can not speak for the food that could be ordered because we didnt order any.
