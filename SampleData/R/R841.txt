INCREDIBLE!!! Yes all in caps ;-P. I'm not an Indian but have tried quite a few Indian restaurants around. Without any doubt this is the best!!! Especially the coconut naan! I'm obsessed into the sweet smell... There are raisins in it! Yummy yummy! The old Delhi butter chicken is wonderful too. Come and try yourselves!!
