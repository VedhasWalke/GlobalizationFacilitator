Lunch with the family! Their lunch buffet has been extremely fresh and there are so many options to choose from.  Crab Masala in the lunch buffet was a highlight for an indian restaurant.  The staff is very attentive and the decor is fresh and updated. I love this place!!. The tea served in Madras style is an eye catcher, i am not sure whether we can see this in Madras (Chennai) anymore.
I am glad this place is not Masala Grill any more!!!
