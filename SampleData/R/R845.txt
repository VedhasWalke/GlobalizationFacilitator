This is very close proximity to Princeton University. It's in nice location. Went there for lunch a few days ago, it was quite empty around 1 pm except 3 other guests sitting  next to us. Modern decor and nice interior.
The server was attentive but rude. I asked if he can lamb/goat is cooked well (I don't like soggy or chewy). He said "no sever/waiter" in any restaurant can ensure that. I was like it's a simple question, dude!! We ordered lunch special.
We ended up ordering chicken special and my wife breakfast special.
Overall it's little pricey but food was very average and bland. Not authentic Indian food. There are too many good restaurants in Central Jersey but this is definitely not one of those.
