Had the pleasure of meeting Gibson at our visit. No joke, this guy has the moves. Gibson is a 5 star guy. Great food. Mango Lassi 10/10. The Dosa did some work on my soul. Old Delhi Butter Chicken had my mouth dancing and the ambiance took me back to the deep recesses of my most pleasureable memories. What. A. Time.
