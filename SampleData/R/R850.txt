My favorite restaurant in the area (My top 5 places in whole of US). I could travel to Princeton just to eat here. Owners are nice, warm people who will often come to talk at the table, but won't disturb while you're eating. And the best part- the food is great! Be it their Dosa or north Indian curries, everything is top notch.
