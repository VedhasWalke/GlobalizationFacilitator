Absolutely the best South Indian food in Tri state area! After they opened and my wife asked me to take her there I finally had a chance to visit this place! What a gem I really loved the food and believe me I'm chef myself! And I also cook INDIAN food! Their coconut chutney and Sambhar are the best I've had outside of India! I will be definitely going to be returning more often!
