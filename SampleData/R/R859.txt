The service in this restaurant was amazing. The restaurant decoration was really nice and all the servants were very helpful. I think it was the owner that was taking our order and he was pleasant to deal with, also providing good tips when ordering.
The food was good except for the non-veg tandoor platter. The Mushroom Manchurian was a different item not usually found at restaurants but tasted amazing. The lamb biryani was really good, the lamb was thoroughly cooked and full of flavor. The non-veg grill platter in the appetizer was okay, some of the chicken was really plain and it was definitely not worth the money.
