Went here with some dear friends. Cute and welcoming restaurant. Appetizers were amazing - Kalaan Manchurian was out of this world. I've had chicken manchurian many places, but this is the best by far. All of the entrees were divine - the chicken tikka masala and paneer kofta were my favorites, but everything our table shared (about 6 dishes) was delish!!!! The staff were very friendly, and one of the chefs came to the table to chat as well. I will most certainly go back !!!
