My brother suggested this place and he told me that you won't be disappointed and indeed I wasn't.  I am from India myself and I have not tasted this kind of food there as well. I couldn't stop eating ... please do try this . It's very authentic south Indian food with a homely touch .  Very less oil and a treat to the palate.  
You must try: crispy okra, appam,  mushroom in black pepper sauce and avial... the badam milk is very good as well.
John is the person who is the owner and chef . He personally made the appam to perfection. He made sure that the food is served to perfection. Amazing passion and it pours into the food also.
I am coming back and bringing my parents and my friends.  
I have not written any review ever but I had to write this one.
