Tried the saturday buffet. The south indian food items were delicious.
They had some unique items from south india, such as the goat brain curry ! The cuisine is chettinad style. Also suspect that baking soda was used copiously, given how thirsty we were after our meal. The rasam and sambar were awesome.  Dosa's were good, but heavy on the oil.Good to try once in a while.
