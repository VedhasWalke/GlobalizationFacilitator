Booked this place for dinner with friends on 7/7, turned out to be our most harrowing dining experience (trust me hv seen a gazillion poorly managed Indian restaurants, but this took the cake). The place was extremely short staffed and those present had no clue on how to service guests. It took the longest time for them to ever get the menus, followed by a slow piecemeal appetizer delivery and by that time they totally lost the plot at the restaurant. After waiting for 15-20 mins for someone to take entree order, the person who came in was taking orders on phone while standing at our table. The dinner service beyond that can only be described as chaotic.
On the food itself, largely average Indian food made worst by the lack of basic service - sambhar was Luke warm at best, reshmi kebab was cold by the time it came out, only item that was good - bhuna lamb in appetizers. Oh did I mention they were out the 3 main South Indian chicken dishes.
Would urge people to not visit the place, unless they train, augment the staff.
