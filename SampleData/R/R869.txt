I went here recently for dinner while visiting Princeton. We really enjoyed our meal - service was friendly and the food was very good. I particularly enjoyed the dosa filled with potato. There are lots of vegetarian and vegan options, which is wonderful, but they do serve meat dishes too. Prices were very reasonable. I will be back when I'm next in town.
