The food is delicious and we appreciated the owner's attention to details. Real banana leaf plates and clay pots heightened our dining experience. The service was incredible, they stayed open a little later to accomodate us as we just flew in from Chicago!
We consider ourselves Indian food snobs, and this place gets high marks! We would highly recommend this flavorful place!
