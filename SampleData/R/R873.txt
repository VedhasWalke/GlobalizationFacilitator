Came for a family lunch on a Sunday .... I'm born n brought up in chennai and I loved this place ..... right balance of veg n non-veg options ... the food was tasting great n the spices were consistent... The ambience was also good ... a small restaurant with not a lot crowded like other Indian restaurants in Edison ... so the family was able to have a nice time ....overall I would highly recommend this place if someone who wanted to get a flavor of South Indian cuisine!
