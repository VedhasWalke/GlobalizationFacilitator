This is simply the best restaurant in Princeton, at least when price and quality are the main factors.  All the dishes that I've ordered here are cooked exceptionally well, with close attention to detail, and I appreciate the novelty of eating your food on a leaf.  
The naan bread is unfailingly crispy and buttery, while the generous portions of curry are bursting with flavor and have a smooth texture.  I once ordered fish, which turned out to taste distinctly un-fresh, so I stick to the chicken, which is always excellent.  
Their daily lunch deals are particularly good, since you get this same wonderful food for an unbeatable price, along with a choice of appetiser.  Best of all is the Sunday buffet, which might ostensibly resemble any other Indian buffet, but stands apart from the competition because of the sheer quality of the offerings.  Restaurants typically use buffets as an opportunity to unload mediocre and lukewarm food in large quantities, but this isn't the case with Chennai Chimney.
