This is an edit of the review I posted earlier today.
I am incredibly impressed with the concern this restaurant took for our dissatisfaction with the food and delivery; after voicing our concerns we were pleasantly surprised to have a representative from the restaurant at our doorstep with a brand new order, and sincere apologies for our experience.
Never in my life have I experienced such excellent customer service, especially in the food service industry. Upon tasting the food the quality was much improved. The garlic naan here is the best I've ever had, and compliments the flavors of the entrees we ordered. The vegan samosas were crisp, delicious, and satisfying.
I would venture to say the first encounter was a fluke, thus the 4/5 stars, but otherwise Chennai Chimney is a solid choice for Indian cuisine.
In short, any establishment that takes pride in their food and customer service experience is one definitely worth visiting. We look forward to dining in next time. Thank you to Chennai Chimney for going above and beyond what an ordinary establishment would do.
