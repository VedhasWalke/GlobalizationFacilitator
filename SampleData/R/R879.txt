This is more like a 3.5 with the ability to become a 4 with some changes. First, I have to say that the food was really good. My family is South Indian and enjoyed most of the food which had pretty authentic tastes. We were there with a larger group and the service was so-so. Friendly but slow and food came out staggered with some people almost done their meal before others started. The manager (was wearing a tie so I assume so) did come out to explain that they were short staffed and that was the reason. But I heard from a few others that service tends to be slower. However I will say everyone was friendly.
One member of our party tried to use the restroom but it was in horrible condition. When she reported it nothing was done but it's possible the person didn't understand.
I'd try this again for the food and hope for better service.
