The food was very good! Great service, great ambience. Naan and bullet Naan (with hot green chilies) was excellent! ordered the lamb varruval, fried okra,, ennai katharikhai, peshwari lamb- all very very good! They also have dosa and appam.
Give this place a try if you like authentic South Indian veg and non-veg food!
