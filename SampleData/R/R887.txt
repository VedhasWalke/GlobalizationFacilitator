This is my new favorite restaurant in Princeton. I can't really judge its authenticity but the South Indian food I've had here tops anything I've had in Manhattan. The dosas in particular are done perfectly -- light, soft and crispy. My favorite dishes are the dosas, uddapam, parotta and basically everything on the Chennai Specials. The only thing I'd skip is the Biryani. Note, the food tends to be really spicy so watch out! The service can be a bit hectic but the owner is super nice and helpful.
