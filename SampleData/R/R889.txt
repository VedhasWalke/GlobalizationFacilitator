Great ambience. And innovative attempt to revitalize traditional banana leaf style plating with copper and bronze utensils. We called ahead and came 40 mins prior to closing but had to wait half an hour before we got seated. The servers were polite. The appetizers were really good- idli/vada combo. The main course while tasted good had liberal application of grease which gave an overwhelming taste when consumed. Note we had the ghee roast and onion uttapam. The chutneys were exquisite and very authentic however the sambhar could have had a thinner consistency with a better dry spice application over extra use of tamarind to avoid over tangyness. The fresh lime soda was reminiscent of having it on streets of Bombay. Overall it was a good experience and I would come back for more.
