Finally, a wonderful South Indian restaurant in downtown Princeton!
I've eaten at Sagar Ratna in New Delhi, Saravanaa Bhavan in NYC, and many more South Indian restaurants throughout the world--and Chennai Chimney is among the very best!
Beautiful, classy decor. Delicious, authentic South Indian food. 50/50 variety of veg and non-veg options on the buffet. Thick, non-watery chutneys and fresh, hot, and soft idlis are to die for.
I've had the weekend buffet several times. Every dish is always fresh, hot, and delicious. There are a surprising number of seafood options--shrimp, crab, and/or fish every time. Often Indian buffets don't include so many seafood dishes, so it's a nice touch that Chennai Chimney does. Also, the quantity of veg and non-veg options is great--my partner is vegetarian, while I'm non-vegetarian and we both leave very satisfied. In fact, my partner comes here multiple times a week, and finds the variety and type of dishes to be always changing and well-balanced between veg and non-veg.
If you want dosas order them from the menu, as they are crispy and delicious. I never like dosas on buffets because they get soggy and cold easily.
Warm chai is included in the price of the buffet. I highly recommend giving Chennai Chimney a try for yourself--you'll find that the service, the food, and the ambiance are wonderful! We're lucky to have this restaurant in downtown Princeton.
