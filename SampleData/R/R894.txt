Was visiting from Chicago and stumbled upon this place with a friend. The food was amazing! I've had Indian food all over the world and this was some of the freshest and most delicious food I've had. The manager/owner Gibson was super helpful and even had the chef make us some dishes that weren't on the menu. The plates with actual banana leaves were a very nice touch and not something you see in many places at all. I would highly, highly recommend this place.
