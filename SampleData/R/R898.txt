This is probably the best restaurant I've been to near Princeton University in terms of taste and price. :) I think it was about $14 for a lunch buffet (which is available Sunday, Friday, and Saturday as of now). There were more choices than at other Indian restaurants I've been to here -- maybe around 15 dishes? Someone on here mentioned their seafood before, which I thought was okay, but they had other much better offerings, like chili chicken (which was soo good omg), pakora, chicken tikka masala, chicken/vegetarian biryani, ahh. I hope they stay around! :) I can't speak to authentic-ness but it's at least better than the other places nearby. ^_^
