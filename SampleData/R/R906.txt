I was dissaponted and dissatisfied with the food offered here. I had high expectations from the place as the place came highly recommended by my husband which he had visited once before with friends. The food was extremely salty and the curry we ordered had no coconut milk in it even though the menu said so. I gave them 3 stars because they changed my food but by the time they brought the new curry I had lost my appetite. I tried it later at home and found it to be satisfactory. Overall the meals offered ruined a perfect dinner for me and my husband. Sometimes you may be lucky to get what you like for example my husband liked their food before (the reason he returned with me).
