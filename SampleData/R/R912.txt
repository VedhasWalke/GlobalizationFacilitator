A group of us went for lunch a few days after they opened. Hot, new and exciting !! They serve authentic South Indian food-much needed new addition in downtown Princeton. Being from Chennai their decor and coasters brought me back nostalgic memories. We tried a variety of their dishes-  marina salad, avial, chicken chettinad, lamb. Scotch eggs , everything was enjoyed by everyone at the table. Do check this new place out and I think you won't be disappointed.
