Amazing food!!!The service started a bit in the wrong side but once the food came through I was completely satisfied. Try the Palkova for desert.The restaurant honestly attempts to serve traditional South Indian food instead of the usual menu available every other Indian place. This is my new favorite Indian restaurant in NJ.
