Took my wife out to dinner and, as vegetarians, we frequent Indian restaurants in the area. We had to wait for about 15 minutes to be seated, which was OK considering it was Friday night. That did not bother us at all. The real trouble began after we were seated. It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to come over for the first time and take our order. We ordered appetizers and entrees. I also ordered a diet coke.
The appetizers were tiny; one arrived in 10 minutes and the other arrived about 30 minutes later, just before my main meal arrived. My wife received her main meal in about 15 minutes, shortly after the first appetizer came. I had to wait about 35 minutes for my entrée. The diet coke was flat (oddly very common at other Indian restaurants).
The waiter never came over again, although the gentleman who seated us did ask me twice if all was ok. His concern seemed genuine however he was not our waiter.
Sadly, the food was not worth the wait. In comparison to nearly every other Indian restaurant I've eaten at, this was a big disappointment. The bill was $46 for the two of us and I reluctantly gave a $6 tip, which was very generous given the long wait and lack of service.
