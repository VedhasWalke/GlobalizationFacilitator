This restaurant is one of the best Indian restaurants in the New Jersey area.  
You can savor all the south indian dishes whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian from dosas to chicken tikka masala.  
I love dosa and knew I would try one, I chose Mysore masala which was slightly spicy and stuffed with potatoes. It was a little thicker than a plain dosa would be, but was still golden brown and crispy. What stood out the most was the trio of sauces that came with it. For an entree I ordered a fish curry. It contained kingfish which I would compare to swordfish or a similar firm fish. It was a good choice for this fragrant and spicy curry. I slightly regret asking for a spice level of 7, next time I'll see what 5 is. My dining companion ordered an eggplant curry that was a bit less spicy and had a totally different flavor than my dish. We both enjoyed our choices.
Service was very friendly but they seemed to hold back some of our dishes possibly because of a miscommunication. I will surely return to try other items, and possibly even stop in for a quick dosa lunch( definitely a lunch sized portion). I foresee an update to 5 stars after a few more visits.
