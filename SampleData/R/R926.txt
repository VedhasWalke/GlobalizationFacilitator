Would be a great date place- went to dinner with friends and the ambience was nice- just the right amount of casual but classy and not too pricey- roughly $8-$25 range depending on what you want with most dishes in the $15 range.  Their spices are really fresh and the chicken was tender and cooked well.  Really enjoyed the presentation as well with the different colored plates. Their naan has a few options and are quite tasty.   Good flavors!  Out of the few Indian places in the area, this one is my favorite now.
