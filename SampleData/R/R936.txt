Ate dinner here, not crowded.  Seating was fast. Our waiter was friendly and was willing to answer questions. Had the samosas, you get two fairly large puffs and the usual dipping sauces. Very good. The main meal was ordered medium spicy. It was mild and could have used a extra kick. I guess this place goes low on the spice compared to others, so if you like some spice ask for at least medium-high spice level. The quality of the food was very good and I would go back and try some of their other dishes. The one annoying factor is the several of their tables were very uneven, so when you put your arms in the table it would rock several inches and almost spill your drink only to rock to the other side when the opposite person did the same. Makes for a difficult dinning experience. How could you not know that your tables are so wobbly. It's such a simple thing to fix. Level your tables and you could get a 5 star review.
