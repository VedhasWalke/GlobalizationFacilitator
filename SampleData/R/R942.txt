Beautiful dining rooms and  ethnic decoration.
Delicious food and friendly service. Bhartha, $15, is a sweet creamy dish of roasted eggplant. Chicken Achari, $16, is a tomato puree curry with acidic, sweet and spicy flavors which are enhanced by grounded pepper cones. Both are unique and delicious.
The owner is helpful to explain the menu and dishes which makes it great experience.
