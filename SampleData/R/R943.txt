The delivery I ordered from Palace of Asia was not great. Although the Tandoori Mixed Grill ($21.95) had a generous portion size, the quality was not good. The chicken was very dry, the lamb was chewy and tough, the shrimp was fishy and not fresh, and the marinades were not very flavorful. The seekh kebab was probably the best part, but it was quite salty. It did come with a generous amount of basmati rice though.
The Indian Masala Tea ($2.25) was quite bland, and it was not packaged well: the lid was leaking and there was a hair on top.
It's possible I just got unlucky, as several recent reviews have mentioned quality inconsistencies, but I won't be ordering from them again, especially with better options such as Global Grill and Halal Meat nearby.
(2/5 stars for quality, rounding up in case I was just unlucky)
