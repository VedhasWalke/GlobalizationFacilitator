This is my go-to Indian restaurant in the area! I order take out from here probably at least twice a month and dine in every few months. Indian food is my ultimate comfort food so I was elated when I discovered this place.
The best parts:
-The food is mouthwatering. Every dish I've ordered from here so far has been flavorful and always cooked to the perfect spice level
-very affordable and delicious lunch buffet on the weekdays (I forgot how much it costs exactly)
-easy to navigate their website - you can order everything directly from their site for pick-up from any of their locations
-FAST & friendly service, whether you are dining in or ordering to go
-spacious enough to host a dinner party (they even have a private dining room you can reserve)
-beautiful decor - perfectly capturing a palace like feel in India
I always go to their Lawrenceville location. My order is usually paneer masala, bindhi, or daal makhani with garlic naan. Occasionally I'll treat myself to their Raas Malai or mango lassi for dessert. :)
If you are ever in the area and are craving Indian food, I highly recommend trying this place out!
