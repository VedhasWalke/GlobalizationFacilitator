I came here recently for Indian buffet and really not much to complain about. The servers were very attentive. They had many options for the buffet. Chaat, naan, rice, creamy veggies and meats, pickles, raita! The whole works for Indian flavor! I love Indian food.
Super packed during lunch time and the restaurant itself is beautiful and very unassuming from the outside.
I would recommend :)
