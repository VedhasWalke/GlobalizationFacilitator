Blown away by how delicious this spot is!!! My father recommended this to us because he sometimes goes for their lunch buffet at work, and we came on a Sunday so we sat down and ordered a la carte.
We were pleased when we saw the meal for 2 option and got that for the four of us and we ordered one more dish. This package was great and came with 2 soups (split pea), pakora, papadam, rice, bread, daal, meat samosas, tandoori chicken, seekh kabob, and chicken tikka masala. A bunch of food that could have fed the four of us!! Just incase we ordered a palak paneer. We actually subsitutednthe chicken tikka masala for paneer as well and it was all of our favorites! The daal with rice was incredible too. Loved it all!
