This is one of the nicest Indian restaurants I've ever been to. It has marble tables and a fountain on the inside. I was amazed by its extravaganza when I first walked in.
They have daily lunch buffets. The buffet consists of some chicken dishes, one lamb dish, white rice, fried rice, and some vegetarian options plus the dessert.
The food I had was fresh and warm. I love spicy food, I've been to Indian buffets where the food was not spicy at all, this Indian buffet had a good amount of spiciness in a few of its dishes just like the way I wanted.
