The lunch buffet setup is far more enticing then dinner.
Having been to Palace of Asia for both lunch and dinner, I prefer the lunch although it is far from perfect.  The lunch fare is far more flavorful and there are many options to choose from.  Vegetarians and meat eaters shouldn't have an issue for lunch.  There are also generally two-three dessert options for lunch as well.  The price is a little pricier but overall still a good deal.
All of the dinner fare lack the same punch I'd expect and just disappointingly bland.  I'm not sure why that is the case but this seems to be the norm after several visits.  Pakora's aren't salted, the veggie  biryani is bland, and the malai koftas aren't spiced right.  On the plus side all the breads are great.
A big plus is the decor of the restaurant and the service, which is above the quality of the food.  The decor is fancy and the detail is definitely eye pleasing.
