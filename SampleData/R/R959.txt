Not the best lately . The food has been going downhill. Not allot of flavor . Beans tasted like they have been sitting around too long and were served. Burned with a small piece of bread in the bottom , so it was from another table ! Sorry guys don't forget where you came from . I have been going here since they were at a sufferer location years ago , and am very disappointed
