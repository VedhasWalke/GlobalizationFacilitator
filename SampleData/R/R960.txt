I rarely write reviews and I hate to write a bad review but dinner was really bad. Fish curry was very watery without flavor. Mutter paneer had lot of MUSHROOMS in it - obviously watery (because of all that mushrooms and mutter). Lamb pasanda - well bunch of whole black pepper seeds and cardamom- see pics for yourself.
For sure one of the worst food I have ate. Maybe we were too tired or just wrong time. But I will certainly not recommend dinner time to anyone.
Service was bad too and they added 18% gratitude (without permission) for table of 4.
