Went here on the recommendation of a friend. Very nice restaurant. Was warmly welcomed by the staff when we came in on a Friday night. The food was excellent and the service was also quite good. We had vegetable samosas, and then a lamb dish and a chicken dish. Both were very tasty and cooked very well.  Naan bread with garlic was also quite good.
I wish I tried this place sooner. I'll definitely be back
