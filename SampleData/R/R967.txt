I have been to this location as well as the maple shade one on several occasions. Both locations get an A+ for decor. The inside is one of the nicest Indian restaurants I have been too. That being said, I have found the food to be inconsistent. If you are looking for a great Vindaloo, then this is not the place. It was one of the worst I have had. Now the chicken cashmere on the hand was fantastic. Everything else I have tried there has been somewhere in the middle. Not bad, but not great either. I also find them to be overpriced, especially in comparison to other options nearby with better food.
