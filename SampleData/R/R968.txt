Been back here a few times and the food has been consistently good. The chili chicken appetizer is tender, and has a great kick. The gravies with the main dishes are flavorful & delicious, based on sampling of at least 6 different dishes. Best of all is the service, as it's leagues above other Indian restaurant in the general area. Definitely worth paying an extra dollar or two per dish for the ambiance & food quality. It's mind-blowing to see this restaurant rated 3 & 1/2 stars on Yelp, while other Indian places with no ambiance, spotty service, & hit or miss food quality are rated higher.
