Lunch buffet=3 stars
Restaurant= 4 stars
I have come to this restaurant since it was in its prior location years ago.
I enjoy all the dishes I try. They have an excellent vegetarian selection if you avoid meat. The food is fresh and the sauces are flavorful.
The restaurant is comfortable, well decorated and has easy parking.
Take out is always warm, fresh, and well packed to prevent leaks.
However, I tried the lunch buffet for the first time and was underwhelmed. The quality did not match the restaurant. The naan seemed dry and old, the the selections were perhaps intended to be creative, but I'd prefer regular menu options, the Malai kofta was emptied and not replaced and the desserts were lacking-I've never been to an Indian buffet that didn't offer Gulab jamun.
I will definitely be back to order meals and take out but never for lunch buffet.
