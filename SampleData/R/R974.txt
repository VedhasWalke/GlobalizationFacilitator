We really love dining here, and are so happy to have such a high-quality Indian buffet right here in our neighborhood.  Our favorite is the Chicken Tandoori, but everything is quite delicious.  I also enjoy the hot Masala tea to go with the meal.  Their buffet has many choices!  My husband likes their lamb or goat, and we both love the dish that has okra in it or their homemade cheese and spinach dish. Nice choices for salad, nice sauces, rice & appetizers too. We are always pleased after eating here.
