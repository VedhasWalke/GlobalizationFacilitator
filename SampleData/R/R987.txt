This was our first time here for a Monday Lunch Buffet on 11/19/18.
As far as lunch buffet's go, this wasn't bad. I have been to POA in Lawrenceville for dinner and really liked it so I figured I would give it a try.
Do not let curb appeal dissuade you as it is very nice and modern inside. The service is very friendly.
The food was standard Indian buffet food with a few veggie, one chicken and lamb dishes. I tried everything and enjoyed most but there were a couple of dishes that tasted sour and not to my liking.
I would go back to try their dinner menu when the food tends to be better.
