We had lunch at this place couple of days ago. Food was good. Navaratan Kurma, Gulabjamun were top notch. One thing I liked about their buffet is, they had ample variety for vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians. At the same time, it did not have too many dishes where you will be confused what to try.
This place has excellent ambiance suited for large parties and special occasions. I would definitely give it a try again when I am in the area.
