Was a reco from a friend who had been coming for years.  We have our all time favorite Indian Restaurant in Newtown -Yardley PA and figured we give this one a taste try.  
Was just okay.  The service was really good.  Lots of choices, so took us a while to process through our options.  Nice presentation.
We ordered good dishes, however we felt that similar food at our preferred Indian restaurant was way better taste wise.
So in short a nice place, large space, large menu, average price point.  
However, if in Newtown-Yardley PA area, give Indian Garden a try.
