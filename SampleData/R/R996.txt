Palace of Asia is kind of hidden but certainly worth the search.  Located in an off the main street plaza, it is a marvel in Indian decoration inside.  I have had dinner and the lunch buffet.  I enjoyed the dinner service the most.  The naan and apps were all enjoyable.  Large portions.  I had the tikka mixed grill as that is a fairly safe dish.  All marinated and grilled meats with jasmine rice.  The best dish at our table was the butter chicken.  It was full of flvaor in a beautifully done cream sauce.
The lunch buffet was a great value.  There was a combination of meat dishes and vegetarian dishes.  I enjoyed the chicken thighs, and the cheese in spinach.  It is a great location for groups and special events.
