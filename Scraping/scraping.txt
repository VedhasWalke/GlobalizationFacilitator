So what I've understood (steps the bot should take):

Process 1:
	1. Go to client business page
		- Basic business info
		- Search terms that yielded this business (for future, finding competitors)
		- Make list of links to competitor businesses (for finding & evaluating very close competitors)
		- All reviews
	2. Go to directly related business pages
		- Basic business info
		- All reviews
		- Do not navigate to any more businesses from this
	3. Search Yelp for the search terms that yielded client business in that location/area
		- Find more (hopefully competitor) businesses
		- Basic business info
		- All reviews
		- Do not navigate to any more businesses from this

Process 2:
	1. Open reviewer files for the reviewers of the client business & competitor businesses
	2. Get links to all reviewer profiles
	3. Visit all reviewer profiles
	4. Sort/categorize reviews & get relevant ones
		- Navigate to those business pages for which the reviews were written & get very basic info about those businesses
	





1) Scrape basic business data on Yelp
	- Name
	- Average rating
	- Phone Number
	- Address
	- Website
	- Description (if present)
	- Reviews (if present; you can set how many reviews to scrape per business, if # entered exceeds # present, rest are blank)
		> Name of reviewer
		> Date of review
		> Rating of review
		> Content of review (what the person wrote, no images)
		> Link to reviewers profile

2) Scrape reviews from reviewer profiles
	- The profile links are already scraped when scraping businesses
	- For each review on the profile, scrape:
		> Name of business which was reviewed
		> Date of review
		> Rating given
		> Content of review
		> Link to review/business reviewed
