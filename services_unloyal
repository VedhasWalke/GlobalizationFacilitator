Did not expect such attitude

This was my first year using 

///

I just started

don't know how we functioned without

I will definitely use this service in the future!

 It's been quite a challenge to find someone

 researching and reading reviews, I found them

 I won't ever go anywhere else again

I think iâ€™d  love to work with them again next year

Would be happy to use them again next year!

second visit 

///

I'm so happy i went with them

Done looking for a company

I would hire the team again.

///

I  honestly have little experience with tree service

///

I was skeptical

///

I read the reviews and gave them a call.

/// 

I cant believe how good they were

///

 so hard to find a good tree company

///

Decided to go with his company 

///

 Will call again for future service.

///

rarely ever leave reviews, but Jon and his team's work blew me away

///

SO GLAD we found 

///

Luckily ran into these guys around the corner

Thankfully Found through yelp

Impressed

decided on them based on the reviews here

found them off google today

searching for a new landscaper, I luckily came across them

Walked in for a quick look and decided to stay

A new customer

///

I came across this facility online

. I wont hesitate to go back 

///

This may become my go to place 

///

This is definitely a new staple that will continue for me.

///

I was nervous when I chose them

///

so I just took a chance

///

never have I ever had such an amazing and life-changing moving experience

///

Fastest, easiest, least stressful move I've had to-date.

///

been the best experience by far.

///

A friend recommended clutter and thank goodness I went with them! 

///

 was very impressed with my experience

///

by far has been THE BEST experience.

///

been a customer less than a week

///

I tried it didnt like it

///

decided to use them  for a try. 

///

I would not use their service again 

///

I decided that my search for a cleaning service was over.

///

Would most likely use another service

///

Wouldnt give them another try

///

 I was a little hesitant at first because this was my first time using this kind of service

///

This was my first time

///

 I went in and was really nervous because I've never been before

///

This was my first experience ever

///

First time here and I will definitely be coming back

///

First time here, and my experience was awesome

///

First time client

///

I wish someone recommended them sooner!

///

This was my first time

///

for the first time

///

I've struggled for years to find a place I loved 

///

Needed some change

///

 I found this place through Yelp and saw the reviews and gave it a try

///

This will definitely be my go-to from now on.

///

being a new customer, I was super nervous

///

would definitely go back!

///

This was our first time at this 

///

 I first reached out through yelp 

///

Dov was a lifesaver -- I had an unexpected need


///

They came on short notice -- So impressed!

///

delivered the best customer experience I've ever had

///


I will definitely hire them again.

///

will definitely work with them in the future

///

will definitely work with them in the future

///

I reached out and they came! Wow!

///

Seems like you get what you pay for. Will come back.

///

At first, the estimate gave me sticker shock.

///

Could not have been happier with his promptness

///

have added them to my list of professionals

///

You really get what you pay for and I'm glad I did!

///

we would absolutely hire him again for his outstanding work!

///

 I will be happy to work with him again.

///

 I am always looking for vendors and service providers

///

 I will be using in the future.

///
 
Would definitely use again.

///

 This time I just went with the professionals.  SUPER HAPPY.

///

I am super happy and look forward to calling them again for future issues and projects

///

I am very pleased with my new installation.

///

He was responsive, explains things well, and came late night on short notice.

///

I was lucky to find him here and Yelp and will ABSOLUTELY be using him in the future. 

///

 We will definitely use him for our plumbing needs.

///

I found Dov through Yelp since he got good ratings.

///

Honestly, so far so good!

///

I called him for the first time and he showed up VERY QUICKLY.

///

I was very impressed by it all.

///

I will be calling him again if Heaven forbid we have anymore issues!

///

Great service and he seems like an honest guy.

///

Can't wait to have another project with Dov.

///

I have rather high standards and found that Dov exceeded my expectations in every respect.

///

came on a day's notice

///

 A great experience.

///

I appreciate the honest service and would happily use them for my next plumbing job.

///

 I wouldn't hesitate to call on Dov again

///

Would definitely call again.

///

No complains whatsoever. He seems like a nice guy too.

///

Dov never did plumbing for us but his response time was amazing

///

I was so pleased with Dov that I called him back to replace a toilet for my tenant the following day

///

I'm happy to have found an expert to rely on going forward.

///

I've finally found a plumber that I'll call on again!

///

Price was reasonable, work seemed good and he's a nice guy to boot!

///

The first time there

///

In the past I have always been hesitant with recommending plumbers as they tend to be hard to work with and harder to find when you really need them. These guys were great and I highly recommend them.

///

We are very satisfied with the end result and would gladly recommend his services.

///

I'm always nervous when I call contractors, plumbers, electricians cause you never know what cost you'll get with them. 

///

 Will definitely be keeping Dov on speed dial.

///

I had an emergency

///

After checking reviews, I called Dov

///

Thank you for both. Weekend was saved!

///

Hopefully we won't have to, but I would absolutely reach out to Dov again for any plumbing needs.

///

If I ever need a plumber for anything, I'll be calling him from now on.

///

I'm very happy with the service Dov provided.

///

I'm satisfied with the results. I will continue to work with Dov.

///

Found Dov through yelp.

///

Will definitely reach out again w/ any future needs - thank you!

///

We will definitely use him again if we have any other problem.

///

Definitely will be recommending Dov to our entire building and all of our friends. 

///

Hopefully we don't need him again but happy we have someone to call that can come so quickly and fix things professionally and efficiently!

///

Dov just left and I'm so impressed, that I had to review him right away.

///

I am so happy and thankful that Dov came and fixed my problem!!!  

///

We really liked him and his work is top notch.

///

Really, amazing.  My 4 year headache fixed just like that.

///

He did what we had others tried  to do but couldn't. Thanks!!!

///

I have to say that our new go-to plumber

///

Emergency situation..he arrived in less than 30 mins and fixed the issue in 15

///

Working with Dov was a pleasure.

///

Would definitely work with Dov again and would recommend him to anyone that could use his service.

///

 I am glad I finally found someone dependable and good.

///

Highly recommended. Thanks so much!

///

He is my new go-to.

///

I will definitely use them again in the future.

///

Really nice guy, and is definitely my go to plumber going forward!

///

 I'd recommend and use again.

///

Will call again.

///

I am very satisfied and no issues in the following 2 weeks.

///

Dov did an excellent job.

///

Quick, effective, and kind. Would hire again

///

I know I will be calling on him next time I have a plumbing issue.

///

I will be using him for all of my plumbing projects.

///

I wouldn't hesitate to contact him again.

///

Won't come back. I will take my business elsewhere.

///

However,I would use the service again. They got the job done.

///

Love them and will use them in the future

///

 I will certainly be using this company in the future!

///

I rarely write reviews but I felt compelled to after the incredible service that I received

///

 I usually use a private cleanup crew, and they do a fairly decent job.

///

But when I used Purify Pros I was more than satisfied with their service! 

///

Iâ€™ll definitely be using them again.

///

Will definitely use again.

///

I was so impressed by the timeliness and the effectiveness.

///

Job well done. Will definitely be using them again and again :)

///

Will use their services again in the future.

///

We will definitely use your services again!

///

I am very impressed

///

We  would definitely use them again.

///

Much better than other cleaning companies I have tried. I definitely recommend them.

///

I  will be using them again! 

///

Will use this company again and recommend it.

///

I will definitely use this service again.

///

Extremely happy. will absolutely use them again.

///

I am going to use their service in the future!

///

Will call again. Prices arenâ€™t so bad either.

///

I got a recommendation from someone

///

Thank you for exceeding my expectations.

///

Iâ€™m hoping to not have any issue again but if I do, I want Anthony and Rich to be the ones who come and do the job. 

///

Iâ€™ve never seen anyone so knowledgeable and experienced 

///

Monday I scrambled to find a company that could replace it same day.

///

I found this company on Home Advisor

///

I will surely be using them again.

///

I have officially found the PERFECT place

///

I came here for the first time yesterday

///

 first time yesterday after spending a lot of time researching

///

probably the cleanest salon I've ever been to. 

///

I was highly impressed

///

I had probably the best experience ever and have already booked my follow up appointment 

///

I've been wanting to try Utopia ever since following them on Instagram.

///

Can't believe it took me this long to try!

///

I will definitely return to this salon and I highly recommend making an appointment there!

///

I regret coming. 

///

This is my second time at Utopia

///

First time going there

///

Had my first visit last Thursday and I have to say it was a great one

///

can't wait to schedule my next appointment here.

///

Took a little trip to queens to check out this cute and very well priced nail salon 

///

was not disappointed !

///

Second time I've been here and I'm super happy

///

 I went to Yelp for recommendations and it led me to Utopia.

///

I will surely return and recommend 

///

This was actually my first time at Utopia

///

I'm so excited to say that I'll be coming here many more times! 

///

finding a new nail place and technician can be even more stressful

///

 I stumbled upon this cozy nail place and I'm relieved I did

///

I have found my new nail place!

///

My new favorite nail place.

///

I stumbled upon this place one day I was in the area

///

 I decided to give PoC a try because they had the least negative reviews 

///

I submitted a last minute quote request

///

This was my first time using movers.

///

 I've never had such a positive experience with any moving company

///

When I move again, I'll definitely hire them.

///

 by far the best moving experience I have ever had!

///

Hired the moving company after finding them on Yelp

///

I hope you have the same experience as me, because it was the least stressful move I've had here,

///

Compared with the other company we have used in the past, subpar

///

was not meeting our expectation

///

I really am so impressed by the whole process as well as the service from start to finish

///

My family was so impressed by the quality of service

///

Second time using them and the move was beyond amazing

///

We were deeply impressed by their commitment

///

I cannot express enough how satisfied I was with my experience

///

This was the BEST moving experience I have ever had

///

 Will def recommend and use again !

///

I discovered while reading the Yelp reviews.  

///

I had an outstanding experience

///

I will definitely use these guys again

///

certainly willing to give them another try

///

This was my first time using Piece of Cake so I was a bit nervous

///

They just became my new official movers from now on.

///

I would call them back

///
